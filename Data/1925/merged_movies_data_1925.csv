Grace is, at heart, a perfectly loving and amiable wife who desires more than anything else on earth to be alone with her husband, to dine only with him and to sit before the fireplace memorizing the days of their romance, but always and ever it seems that her plans are frustrated by the presence, as guest, of either Al Hennessy, her husband's good-hearted former college chum who always seems to do the wrong thing at the wrong time, or her mother, whom she adores, but who seems to inconveniently intrude. Despite all of this her faith and confidence in her husband is unbounded until a day comes when Hennessy accounts for Hyatt's temporary absence by informing her he has gone to lunch with Dagmar, designer of shoes, from Paris. And she discovers them together, which fans the flames, and mother adds a bit of fuel, making it a rather warm situation for Hyatt. Just when William has almost squared himself with Wifie and Mother-in-law, Dagmar persuades him to come to her apartment for the purpose of interesting him in some newly created slipper models. He goes there, but much to her disappointment brings Hennessy with him. Here a new phase of the triangle gets off to a flying start when Al falls for the girl, who in turn is very strong for Hyatt. That night the two men dine at Hyatt's home. After dinner Hennessy blunders along with no damage until he inadvertently mentions that they both have been to the designer's apartment. Mrs. Hyatt picks up the cue and the storm breaks in all its fury. She accuses her husband of being so interested in the designer he forgot to call at the jeweler's for her watch. Hyatt hastens to reassure her that he did call for the watch and it is in his brief-case at the office. He will go get it. He starts for the office and then suddenly remembers that the case was left at Dagmar's apartment. Arriving there the girl plans to hold him and has a siren-like idea which she puts into effect. She pretends to sprain her ankle and faints in his arms. The mark of her lip rouge is pressed on his collar and her perfume scents his coat. That starts the war all over again when he arrives home, and the battle ends in the morning at three when he leaves home for a hotel. The next day Grace makes her decision to divorce him, but happily before the papers are drawn AI Hennessy proves that he may be a blunderer at times but at other times he is a fast worker. He brings Dagmar to the broken home and introduces her as his wife to Mrs. Hyatt.

444. Below the Line,1925,1h 10m,Passed,6.5,28,,"The suggestion that a dog leads a dull life does not apply to that of Rin-Tin-Tin in the screen melodrama, ""Below the Line,"" which is on view this week at Warner's. Rin-Tin-Tin has an eventful career from the time he was owned by the villain to the days when young Donald Cass befriended the animal. Actually Rin-Tin-Tin is the energetic hero of this story, being always busily engaged in either saving himself from a dangerous predicament or rescuing his young master and the heroine. In one of the early scenes Rin-Tin-Tin, now well-known to motion picture enthusiasts, is seen in a crate in the baggage car of a train. He does not take the actions of the baggagemaster in a kindly fashion, so that brute causes the dog to be tumbled out of the car, down an incline to a river. The animal is rescued from this dilemma, and from being a snarling animal he changes to a loyal, affectionate creature. As the story goes on a woman is murdered by Jamber Niles and the Sheriff endeavors to find the criminal through a piece of cloth and a button found in the dead girl's hand. Subsequently we have Donald being attacked by the bloodhounds and Rin-Tin-Tin at first holding them at bay and finally chasing them all away with their tails between their legs. Rin-Tin-Tin does nothing by halves, for he tracks the murderer himself and kills him. There are several good scenes in this picture, but it is on the whole an overdose of melodrama. There is the ceaseless deluge of rain, the poor heroine and the trouble-encumbered hero plunging through the woods, and titles that make one turn one's head away from the screen. One of the praiseworthy portions of this subject is where Rin-Tin-Tin climbs a tree, which is bent and old. He makes two or three attempts and finally pulls himself up to the straggling branches. Dog or no dog, this picture is one of those which to see once, is enough-aye, too much. Aside from Rin-Tin-Tin's performance there is nothing noteworthy about the acting of the principals.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0015616/?ref_=sr_i_444,['Charles Logue'],['Herman C.
