She feeds him leftover pig's feet, cream puff and assorted food, but by the next morning he has a stomach ache. Annie takes him to an orphanage where he will be taken care of, but is herself is taken into custody. While in the orphanage, Annie takes care of Mickey. One day, Mrs. Stewart (a rich dowager) appears, wanting to adopt. The children a paraded before her. Hearing of her contrary nature, Annie makes sure that Mickey catches her attention by saying bad things about him, and by the end of the interview, Mrs. Stewart adopts him. In the orphanage, Annie misses Mickey, and although she's written four letters, Mickey has not responded (because he can't write). Meanwhile, in Mrs. Stewart's home, Mickey is happy, but appears to be angry with Annie, for having said the bad things about him in the adoption process. Annie decides to visit Mickey, and appears by his window just after he's been put to bed since Mrs. Stewart is holding a dinner party. Annie tries to reconcile with Mickey who brings Annie into the house. They pass by the kitchen where Annie takes some cheese dip and Sandy makes off with the main course, a roast beef. The dinner party guests tell about their brushes with supernatural apparitions, although Mrs. Stewart doesn't believe a word of it. Meanwhile, Mickey and Annie find themselves in Mrs. Stewart's bedroom, where Sandy performs tricks for Mickey, and Annie does imitations of Harpo Marx, Chico Marx, Groucho Marx (from the film Horse Feathers (1932)) and Mrs. Stewart. The dinner party ends with the guests humorously wondering if the missing roast beef was also a supernatural occurrence. Upon hearing them leave, Mickey quickly gets back into bed, Sandy goes into Mrs. Stewart's closet, and Annie is stuck in her room. While Mrs. Stewart reads, she sees what she think is an apparition (really just Annie trying to escape stealthily). Mrs. Stewart makes her way to her room, but as she's preparing for bed she sees a ghostly figure (Sandy in a sheet) escape from the closet it door. After a bit of rambunctious chasing, Mrs. Stewart confronts Annie asking her what she's doing in the house. Annie is ejected, but Mickey now doesn't want Annie to go. As he tries to call to her from his second floor window, Mickey falls out of the window to everyone's horror. After some doubt, the doctor declares he will survives and will be able to remove a brace by Christmas. It's Christmas, Mickey is now back to health, and Mrs. Stewart has thrown a party for all the orphans from the orphanage, including Annie. Suspecting something odd, Annie walks up to Santa and discovers it's really Daddy Warbucks.

Jean, a hard-boiled gold digger, asks the honest Polaire and loyal Schatze to introduce her to a new man, and Polaire calls her boyfriend, playboy Dey Emery (David Manners), for help. The girls meet Dey and his friend, pianist Boris Feldman (the film's director Lowell Sherman), at a speakeasy, where Boris bets Jean that if his piano playing does not induce her to love him, he will give her $5,000. Later, at Boris' apartment, Jean pretends to sleep through Boris' concert. Polaire then plays, and Boris, impressed with her talent, offers to be her teacher. He implies that she will have to be his lover as well as his student, however, and Polaire becomes upset when Dey does not protest. Dey mistakenly assumes that an exhibition of jealousy would be unwelcome, and his inaction results in Polaire's acceptance of Boris' proposition. After Polaire leaves to collect her things, Schatze and the heartbroken Dey also leave, but Jean stays to seduce Boris. Jean's calculated exhibitionism is successful, and Boris does not answer the door when Polaire returns. After she leaves, Polaire is hurt in an automobile accident and is hospitalized. Sometime later, Jean tires of Boris and breaks up with him, then pursues Dey. Dey welcomes Jean's attentions until Schatze tells him that Polaire has been in the hospital since their parting. Dey immediately goes to Polaire and proposes to her, and they reconcile. Later, Jean makes an unwelcome appearance at Polaire and Schatze's apartment while Polaire is waiting to meet Dey's father Justin (Phillips Smalley) for the first time. When Dey arrives and Jean learns that Polaire is to meet Justin at the Emery house, she slips a pearl necklace into Polaire's pocket so that she will have an excuse to follow. Polaire's interview with Justin is going splendidly until Jean arrives and intimates that Polaire stole the necklace. Indignant that Dey believes Jean, Polaire storms out, while Jean stays to flirt with Justin. Later, on the day of Jean and Justin's wedding, Schatze and Polaire arrive to retrieve a bracelet that Polaire loaned Jean. Jean returns the jewelry and miserably contemplates her future of wedded boredom as Schatze and Polaire brag about the fun they will have when they sail for France that afternoon. The trio are soon drunk, and Jean decides that she cannot exchange her freedom for Justin's fortune. She sneaks out of the house with Schatze, but Polaire is caught by Dey. Dey apologizes to Polaire for misjudging her, but Polaire leaves anyway. The determined Dey follows her onto the ocean liner, where Polaire consents to marry him when he states that he is certain of her virtue.

He plans to divide his fortune between his cousin, lawyer Robert Waldo, who has taken him in during his sickness, and Dr. David Graham. David considers Duncan his mentor, although, unknown to him, Duncan is actually his father. Waldo convinces Duncan to leave all his estate to David in a plot to get the money along with Duncan's nurse, Jane Chase, who loves David. Waldo, who has a smiling face and apparently benevolent personality, has a hateful, treacherous soul. He plans to frame David by giving him a motive for a murder that Waldo will commit. Now a hopeless invalid, John asks David to end his suffering, but David refuses to give him the necessary medication, so Waldo decides to help John die to suit his own purposes. At Christmas, Waldo invites David to a party for orphans, asking him to play Santa Claus. Instead, David sends Wilfred Morgan, an idle tramp, who becomes drunk and disappears. Left alone with Duncan, Waldo gives him an overdose of the drug David had prescribed, believing he is committing the ""perfect crime."" However, Morgan recovers sufficiently to see what is happening. When David is arrested and tried for murdering John, Waldo offers to defend him, but presents a very poor defense, hoping that the jury will convict David and sentence him to die. David instead receives a life sentence, and while Waldo is awarded John's estate due to David's disqualification, the land is unobtainable while David is still alive. Waldo secures David's release by forging a suicide note left by John, then decides to kill the young man himself. Waldo must first deal with Morgan, however, for the tramp has used his knowledge of the murder to blackmail him. Waldo runs Morgan over with his car, but the injured man reaches Jane and tells her of Waldo's schemes before he dies. Meanwhile, Waldo has enticed David into his cellar, where he intends to asphyxiate him by surrounding him with candles that will use up all of the oxygen. Jane rushes to Waldo's house and shoots him when he fails to reveal where David is. The police arrive in time to save David, and Waldo dies realizing that people cannot be manipulated like pawns in a chess game.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0023768/?ref_=sr_i_196,"['Jo Swerling', 'Dan Nelson']",['Roy William Neill'],"['Mae Clarke', 'Alan Dinehart', 'Neil Hamilton', 'Charles Sellon', 'Charles Coleman', 'John Sheehan', 'Shirley Hart', 'Jean Ann Magnett', 'Billy Shirley', 'Mary June Smith']",,,,,"December 24, 1932",['United States'],,['Columbia Pictures'],,"['Crime', 'Mystery', 'Romance']",['English']

When Jim arrives in the small town, he is told that there are two Fred Smith families in Scotch Valley, the rich Smiths and the poor Smiths. Jim assumes that the Smiths he is looking for are the poor ones, and is directed to a house where four children live in poverty. In the absence of her recently deceased mother and deserting father, Sally, the oldest child, has taken over the responsibilities of rearing the other three children. Initially, Sally mistrusts Jim's intrusion, but later realizes his good intentions and accepts his help. Wanting to find food for the children, Jim asks about their neighbors, and Pete, the oldest boy, informs Jim that one neighbor, Sam Pelgram, once beat him and later cut off their water supply. Jim, unable to believe that any man could be so cruel, goes to see Pelgram for himself and discovers that Pete's description is accurate. After failing to reason with mean-spirited Pelgram, Jim tries to reason with his wife, but soon realizes that she is only interested in seducing him. Jim seeks the legal help of William J. Hansen to begin adoption procedures and, in town, meets Olive Smith, an attractive young woman to whom he is instantly attracted. Sally soon becomes jealous of Jim and Olive's relationship and competes with Olive for his attention. Meanwhile, Pelgram organizes a group of local men to run Jim out of town by abducting and whipping him. Jim survives the ordeal and later discovers that Pelgram wants the Smith ranch because he has found oil on it. At the guardianship hearings, Mrs. Pelgram testifies against Jim's character by fabricating a story about how he made sexual advances toward her. The judge, however, is convinced of Jim's suitability as a parent and grants him custody of the children. Returning to the Smith ranch, Jim and the children are shocked to see their father, who has just been released from San Quentin. Smith announces that, just moments before, he sold the ranch to Pelgram. When Smith learns about the oil on the land, he welches on his deal with Pelgram, and Pelgram kills him. Pelgram is then arrested and led away to prison. Despite his realization that he has been living with the wrong Smith family all along, Jim decides to remain with his newly adopted family.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0022625/?ref_=sr_i_446,"['Mildred Cram', 'Frank Dolan', 'Doris Malloy']",['John G.

Clark pays Brent for the pup, guessing that the pup's father was probably a range dog, and names it ""Boy."" By summer, Boy is full grown. One day, as Clark rides the trails, Jackson's daughter Ginny begins to shoot at him and says that mountain folk don't like strangers. When Clark tries to soothe her, she slaps him in the face. Ginny returns to her ranch, where she tells Jackson that she has seen Clark snooping around. When Jackson tells Brent that he wants to quit poaching, Brent threatens him. Later that day, Boy gets his leg stuck in a fox trap. Ginny discovers him and takes him back to the ranch to dress the wound, but Brent enters and demands that she get rid of Boy. When Brent makes sexual advances toward Ginny, Boy bites him. Before Brent can get his pistol out, Ginny lets Boy go, and he returns to Clark, who redresses the wound. Swiebach and Clark ride out on the trail and leave Boy tied up outside the cabin. When Brent begins to whip Boy, Clark hears him barking and returns. The two men fight with guns, and Clark is hit in the abdomen, while Moran is hit in the hand. Boy races to Ginny, who follows him back to the cabin and helps Clark inside. She tells Boy to go to the Bar T Ranch for help while she tends to Moran's wounds. Later that night, Boy returns with some men from the ranch, who decide that Clark must be moved until his wounds heal. When Boy sees Clark leaving, he tries to chase after him, but gets lost. Boy mates with a she-wolf, and together they have a litter of pups. Boy kills a moose and a cow for food, but a rancher spots him and offers a $500 reward for his capture. Brent stalks Boy, who runs to the Bar T Ranch for safety. Brent enters and a man named Kinney is selected to decide Boy's fate. Boy realizes that they plan to kill him and escapes out the window, but Brent fires at him as he runs away, wounding him severely. Months pass and Boy recovers. One day, as Brent makes violent advances toward Ginny, Jackson enters. The men fight and Brent kills Jackson. Ginny escapes on her horse, but falls off and Boy comes to the rescue. They make it to Clark's cabin, where Brent and his men see smoke coming from the chimney and guess that Ginny is there.
