But circumstances indicate he has stolen all of the money, so she clouts him on the head, killing him. She then learns he didn't steal the money, digs it up and donates it to an orphanage, and surrenders to the police, where she learns that Damitrod is not dead.

314. The Eddie Cantor Story,1953,1h 55m,Approved,5.7,211,,"Eddie Cantor and his wife Ida arrive at Warner Bros. studios in Burbank, California, for a private screening of The Eddie Cantor Story. Just before the film rolls, Cantor whispers, ""Ida, I've never been so nervous in all my life."" The story begins on New York's East Side in 1904. Thirteen-year-old Eddie, eager to be accepted by neighborhood hoodlum Rocky Kramer, entertains a crowd at a political rally by singing, unaware that Rocky and his gang are using the opportunity to pick the listeners' pockets. After a kind Irish cop escorts Eddie home to his Grandma Esther, Eddie sets off to deliver Sabbath candles to the home of merchant David Tobias, whose daughter Ida invites Eddie to stay for dinner. Soon after, Mr. Burke from the Educational Alliance persuades Grandma Esther to send Eddie to the Surprise Lake Camp for Boys. Eddie's vocal performances make him an instant hit with the campers and on the way home, he wins a contest at Miners' Bowery Theatre. In the audience is Mr. Lesser, a producer who arranges for Eddie to join the Gus Edwards Kid Kabaret. For the next several years, Eddie travels with the show, sending Grandma Esther souvenir spoons from each city he visits. When Eddie becomes too old for the Kid Kabaret, he returns home. Rocky Kramer, now a crooked politician with Tammany Hall, offers Eddie a job at his Coney Island nightclub. Although he's only a singing waiter, Eddie, who is still fond of childhood sweetheart Ida, boasts that he is the star of the show to impress her father. One evening, Ida, her family, and Harry Harris--another of her admirers--visit the club. Horrified, Eddie sets down his tray and provides his audience with an unscheduled solo performance, but Ida's family nevertheless discovers the truth. Ida is angry at Eddie for lying, but when he tells her that a famous producer wants him to perform in London, and that he wants Ida to accompany him as his wife, she happily elopes with him. Upon discovering that the producer is broke, however, the newlyweds return home. Eddie remains unemployed until Jimmy Durante, the piano player at Kramer's club, gets him a spot in a Los Angeles show entitled Canary Cottage . The show is a success, but its star, Cleo Abbott, is jealous of Eddie's popularity. To get rid of the scene-stealer, Abbott pretends that famous theatrical producer Florenz Ziegfeld wants Eddie to perform in his new Follies. The ambitious Eddie joyfully returns to New York, only to discover that Ziegfeld has never heard of him, but Eddie, who now has not only Ida but a new baby daughter to support, persuades Ziegfeld to try him out that evening. His performance of ""How Ya' Gonna' Keep 'Em Down on the Farm After They've Seen Paris"" is such a hit that Ziegfeld signs him to a traveling show that includes Will Rogers in its cast. As time passes, Ida has a second daughter while Eddie is on the road, but Eddie later returns to Broadway to star in Ziegfeld's new Follies. On opening night, Grandma Esther, bursting with pride and all dressed up for the show, dies peacefully in a chair. Overwhelmed with grief, Eddie is able to perform a rousing version of ""If You Knew Susie Like I Know Susie"" only by imagining that Grandma Esther is his only audience. During the next several years, Eddie's popularity grows as he becomes identified with hit songs such as ""Bye, Bye Blackbird,"" ""Pretty Baby,"" and ""Yes, Sir, That's My Baby."" On the night that Ida gives birth to their third baby girl, Eddie performs for the Prince of Wales and visits the hospital in black-face. Ida later begs her husband to take a vacation with the family, but Eddie, explaining that he must work hard to stay on top, suggests that they build a house on Long Island instead. Eddie's successful new show makes his schedule even more hectic. In 1929, while recovering in the hospital from the birth of yet another daughter, Ida learns from the newspaper that ""Cantor Says Vacation Is Out."" Weeping, Ida declares that because she and the children are not an important part of Eddie's life, their marriage is over. Eddie is crushed and offers to take Ida and his five daughters to London, but as they are planning the trip, the stock market crashes and he loses everything. With Ida's approval, Eddie returns to work in a new show entitled Whoopee and later performs in his own weekly radio show, ending each program with the tune, ""(I'd Love to Spend) One Hour with You."" Harry, now the family's doctor, advises Eddie to relax and spend time with family, and when Eddie stubbornly refuses, they argue. Harry declares that Eddie has always needed applause to replace the love he never received from a mother and father, while Eddie accuses his old friend of still loving Ida. Not long after, Eddie learns that Rocky has been indicted for murder, and soon after, while working late on a show, suffers a heart attack. Eddie recovers, but becomes morose and quits working. Ziegfeld thinks that Eddie is scared, and Ida wires Harry for help. When Eddie is invited to speak at the boys' camp he attended as a youth, he tells the boys that his experience at camp prevented him from joining up with Rocky, who by this time has been sentenced to death. The boys plead for a song, whereupon Eddie, reluctantly at first, sings a few of his famous tunes. Declaring that he has at last grown up, Eddie launches a string of performances for charity shows. In the projection room, the lights come up and as Eddie and Ida prepare to leave, Eddie exclaims ""I never looked better in my life!""",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0045720/?ref_=sr_i_314,"['Jerome Weidman', 'Ted Sherdeman', 'Sidney Skolsky']",['Alfred E.

In Garnet Basin, many cattlemen are forced to sell their cattle for low prices. Processed in rendering plants, they're only used for their hides, fats and oils, tallow for soap and fertilizers. Without sufficient funds, many ranchers face foreclosures on their lands. Greedy local banker Marvin Parker refuses to extend the mortgage payments or make any new loans to ranchers. He hopes to force the ranchers to sell their lands for cheap to him. In cahoots with Parker are Caddo Sledge, the owner of a cattle rendering plant and womanizing rancher Harry Odell. Odell is engaged to Linda Garnet, daughter of rancher Walt Garnet, but is secretly romancing Melba Sykes, daughter of Tim Sykes. Against the scheming trio of Parker, Sledge and Odell is Ben Anthony, former cattleman, who is the owner of the local freight and stagecoach line. A war of sorts ensues between Ben Anthony and the crooked trio. When the army announces an upcoming purchase of beef from the area, the cattlemen sense that a solution to their problem is near and that ranches, cattle businesses and lands soon could be saved.

Gulacha Ganapati,1953,2h 17m,,8.8,47,,"This is the story of a simple, happy go lucky, poor but with a heart of gold man named ""Narya"" (Shri P.L.Deshpande) who lives in a chawl and works at a local grocery stores. His loyal and honest nature often lands him in trouble because of which his strict and kind heart master always thrash him. Narya is deeply in love with a noble and beautiful girl named ""Leela"" (Chitra) who stays in the same chawl as that of Narya along with her retired politician and ailing father. Leela is the only bread earner of her family and sells flowers outside temples to manage daily expenses. Narya always comes ahead to help her without expecting anything in return which develops a great friendship and bonding between the two. Narya is also a gifted method actor who often goes deep into the skin of famous historical character the moment he sees the respective poster or the photo. On one fine day Narya sees the poster of the great maratha king Chatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj and starts enacting and delivering dialogues like him which catches attention of a Theater group owner who quickly hires him for the titular role of ""Shri Sambhuji Maharaj"" for his upcoming play. The owner pays him the sum of Rs.15/- as an advance from Rs.100/- of his total pay. Narya uses this amount to pay of the rent of Leela's room by comically thrashing away the owner of her room. Leela after seeing his selfless nature falls in love with him. On the eve of the stage performance Narya becomes nervous and runs away from the theater after seeing his master sitting in the audience. Blaming himself for his coward deed, Narya starts delivering his dialogue of his character ""Shri Sambhuji Maharaj"" in the middle of the jungle that catches attention of a ""soon to be formed"" political group. Seeing the enigma and performance of Narya the supremo ""Sudarshan"" (Vinay Kale) decides to use ""Sambhuji's"" character for the publicity of his political party. Sudarshan makes the dirty use of Narya to create a public figure of Shri Sambhuji Maharaj. Shri Sambhuji Maharah is introduced in the media and local issues and made to attend various public seminars and appearances. His idealistic, native and down to the earth charm finds immediate appeal with the citizens. This draws the gullible public to his frequent public addresses and soon Sambhuji Maharaj becomes a cult figure. Meanwhile Sudarshan and his mates earn a lot of wealth out of this and this is the time when he starts showing his true colours. He starts ill treating Narya by not giving him his monthly salary, rest and even food because of which Narya falls unconscious during a public rally. He starts missing his old life and thus writes a letter to Leela . Leela soon reaches Narya and finds out the entire scam. She fools Sudarshan about falling in love with him and wishes her plan about marrying him. She makes him gullible the same way how he did it with Narya and eventually puts him behind the bars. Sudarshan and his mates are sentenced to imprisonment for 3 years while Narya is set free. Narya and Leela get married while Narya's master decides to take care of the newly wed couple.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0325507/?ref_=sr_i_352,['Purushottam Laxman Deshpande'],['Purushottam Laxman Deshpande'],"['Chitra', 'Purushottam Laxman Deshpande', 'Vinay Kale', 'Chitra Navathe']",,,,,,['India'],,['Swati Chitra'],,"['Satire', 'Comedy']",['Marathi']

The plot here involves two burlesque fans---the whole burlesque-show and not just the strippers---reading that a university is preparing a time capsule on the arts and is not considering burlesque for inclusion. They bring film and camera to the board meeting, and force the board members to look at examples of the ""art of burlesque,"" featuring Georgia Southern and Rosita Royce...and her well-trained birds...and the inevitable comedians. As an extra added attraction---for who-knows-who--- the 1953 ""Mr. America"" makes an appearance. For the ""film-in-a-film"" finale, nine barely-clad girls come on stage each carrying a letter that spells out 'Burlesque,' while they sing its praises.

544. El Alaméin,1953,1h 6m,Approved,,,,"Several years after the end of World War II, mechanical engineer Joe Banning returns to North Africa to recall his wartime experiences: As a civilian tank mechanic, Joe delivers the newest models of American-made tanks to the British Seventh Tank Corps. Eager to try out the tank, British captain Harbison, Joe and a partial crew set out on a desert patrol, but because they have a malfunctioning compass and no radio, they are soon lost. The crew picks up a Punjabi solder, Corp. Singh Das, the sole survivor of a search party wiped out by the Germans, and proceeds toward a supply depot, which is being held by a small Italian contingent. After driving off the Italians, the tank crew refuels and loads up with supplies. Joe repairs the Italian radio and Harbison realizes from information broadcast by British headquarters that they are deep behind German lines. Headquarters then announces confirmation of the start of the Allied campaign, led by Field Commander Bernard Montgomery, to drive the Germans, led by ""Desert Fox"" Erwin Rommel, out of North Africa. Anxious to reunite with the division to assist in the upcoming conflict, Harbison welcomes the addition of four Australian infantrymen separated from their unit who wander into the supply camp. Later that afternoon, a lone German fighter plane strafes the depot and is shot down by the tank crew. The pilot bails out and when he is discovered to be severely wounded, Singh offers to kill him to end his suffering. Harbison rejects the offer and while the men debate what to do next, the pilot tries to shoot the captain. Singh throws himself in front of Harbison and is killed by the pilot who later dies from his wounds. The men are further unsettled when they hear on the radio an English broadcast from Germany declaring that the Allied desert campaign will fail. Harbison decides to continue to an old Bedouin tomb near El Alamein, the designated rendezvous point of the brigade. Upon arriving the next day, they find a native and his teenaged niece, Selim and Jara, with their goat and camel camped there. When Selim reveals that the Germans have used the well near the tomb, Harbison orders the water tested for poison. Determining that the water is safe, Harbison suspects that the Germans will likely return and posts guards. When Harbison is unable to home in on the British radio signal, he worries that attack plan may have changed. Distrustful of Selim, Joe is nevertheless startled when Selim offers to sell Jara to the men. Joe agrees to be Jara's guardian when she reveals that her uncle mistreats her, and Harbison promises that Jara will be sent to a mission school after the Allied campaign. That evening, Jara flirts with Joe while Selim knocks out his guard and flees to the Germans to report the arrival of the British tank. The German commander, leading a tank brigade to the tomb for water, sends a truck ahead to verify Selim's report. With Jara's assistance, Harbison's men lure the reconnaissance truck into a trap, killing Selim and most of the Germans, but two Germans escape into the desert. When papers on the dead Germans identify them as members of the Fourth Afrika Korps, Harbison is certain that the escaped Germans will bring back reinforcements. To protect Jara from the anticipated attack, Joe attempts to convince her to flee, but she refuses and hides inside the large tomb's cave. Trying to force Jara's camel to rise, Joe and the others discover a supply of gasoline and ammunition buried inside the cavern. Realizing the importance of the site to the Germans, Harbison again attempts to raise the main British forces on the radio. The tank crew then hears a report that British Prime Minister Winston Churchill has met with Montgomery in the field near El Alamein where the Allies are leading a successful assault on Rommel's forces. After Joe sends Jara away on the camel, Harbison orders the men to cover the tank with a parachute. As night falls, German infantry are spotted approaching the tomb site. The tank crew fends off the attack, but Harbison wonders how long they can hold off the enemy. Joe returns to working on the radio, but is interrupted by another German attack. After again keeping the Germans at bay, Joe is finally able to repair the radio and sends a message to a tank brigade within a few miles reporting Harbison's crew's position. The brigade confirms that the German lines have crumbled and they are on their way to assist Harbison. The Germans then make a rear assault on the tank crew, killing all of the Australians. As German panzers are sighted, Harbison orders his remaining crew to blow up the ammunition dump. The British tank brigade then arrives and after engaging the Germans in a fierce tank, emerges victorious. In the present, Joe reflects on the bravery of the men in Harbison's tank crew and promises never to forget them.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0045725/?ref_=sr_i_544,"['Horace McCoy', 'Herbert Purdom', 'George Worthing Yates']",['Fred F.
