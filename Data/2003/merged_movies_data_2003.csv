The Ballad of Bering Strait,2003,1h 38m,TV-G,7.7,38,49.0,"""The Ballad of Bering Strait"" is a cinema-verite film following seven Russian teenagers who have come to America to become country music stars. Principle photography began in July 1999 when the band, Bering Strait, entered the United States and began recording their first album in Nashville. The film documents the band responding to the twists and turns of the recording industry, rehearsing for their tour, preparing for their debut concert at the Grand Ole Opry, charting the course for their career with their managers, and living every-day life on the farm where they reside in rural Tennessee. The crew traveled with the band to their homes in Obninsk, Russia and to their music conservatories in Moscow, documenting how these two girls and five boys became so adept at playing American country music. The film culminates with the band's arrival on the U.S. stage at Wolf Trap National Park. ""The Ballad of Bering Strait"" is a two and a half year epic that follows Bering Strait's amazing cultural fusion-coming of age journey in America.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0319029/?ref_=sr_i_469,"['Alexei Arzamastsev', 'Natasha Borzilova', 'Andrei Missikhin']",['Nina Gilden Seavey'],"['Alexei Arzamastsev', 'Natasha Borzilova', 'Andrei Missikhin', ""Sergei 'Spooky' Olkhovsky"", 'Alexander Ostrovsky', 'Sergei Pasov', 'Lidia Salnikova', 'Ilya Toshinsky', 'Mike Kinnamon', 'Brent Maher']",,"$1,232","$1,440","$1,440","February 19, 2003","['United States', 'Japan']","['Moscow, Russia']","['NHK', 'The Documentary Center, George Washington University']","Awards, 1 nomination total","['Documentary', 'Music']",['English']
