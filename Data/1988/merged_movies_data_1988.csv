Thirteen year old Molly Roth, the eldest of three offspring of Gus and Diana Roth, lives a carefree life as part of the affluent white minority in South Africa. Race is a non-issue for her as although, under apartheid, the Roths largely exist among other white people like them, she feels equally comfortable around the black people in her life, such as their servants and her parents' black friends. Beyond knowing that they are busy in their work, Molly is unaware of the full extent of what her parents do, Gus a leading member of the South African Communist Party and Ruth an anti-apartheid journalist who also secretly works for the underground in support of the outlawed African National Congress. Shortly after Gus quietly escapes the country to evade probable arrest by the government - Molly believing it just a short work related trip - Molly's carefree life starts to unravel when Diana is detained for ninety days under a new law that allows such detention without ever even being charged with a criminal offense. The goal of Diana's interrogators, led by Inspector Muller, is to get her to divulge details especially of the underground, most specifically proverbial ""names"". Beyond missing her mother, Molly begins to resent the anti-apartheid work which has directly and indirectly impacted her life in a negative way, she wanting a mother, not an activist-mother. As the situation with Diana evolves, which includes someone needing to act as caregivers to Molly and her younger sisters while Diana is in detention, Molly gets a broader perspective of her situation under apartheid as she is able to see more of life just outside her protected white enclave, and as she is made aware of what Diana is trying to achieve for society in her work.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096464/?ref_=sr_i_155,['Shawn Slovo'],['Chris Menges'],"['Barbara Hershey', 'David Suchet', 'Jodhi May', 'Jeroen Krabb√©', 'Nadine Chalmers', 'Maria Pilar', 'Kate Fitzpatrick', 'Tim Roth', 'Phyllis Naidoo', 'Linda Mvusi']",,"$20,815","$2,326,860","$2,326,860","June 17, 1988","['United Kingdom', 'Zimbabwe']",['Zimbabwe'],"['Atlantic Entertainment Group', 'British Screen Productions', 'Channel Four Films']","Won 1 BAFTA Award, 7 wins & 12 nominations total","['Coming-of-Age', 'Drama']","['English', 'Swahili', 'Afrikaans', 'Spanish']"

382. Jane B. for Agnes V.,1988,1h 39m,Not Rated,7.2,1.7K,,"""I'll look at you, but not at the camera. It could be a trap,"" whispers Jane Birkin shyly into Agn√®s Varda's ear at the start of JANE B. PAR AGNES V. The director of CLEO FROM 5 TO 7 and VAGABOND once again paints a portrait of a woman, this time in a marvelously Expressionistic way. ""It's like an imaginary bio-pic,"" says Varda. Jane, of course, is the famed singer (""Je t'aime ... Moi non plus""), actress (BLOW UP), fashion icon (the Hermes Birkin bag) and longtime muse to Serge Gainsbourg. As Varda implies, JANE B. PAR AGN√àS V. abandons the traditional bio-pic format, favoring instead a freewheeling mix of gorgeous and unexpected fantasy sequences. In each, Jane inhabits a new character, playing a cat & mouse game with Varda as they explore the role of the Muse and the Artist, all the while showcasing the multifaceted nature of Birkin's talent. ""I'd like to be filmed as if I were transparent, anonymous, like everyone else,"" says Birkin. But her wish to be a ""famous nobody"" is impossible to achieve; Birkin is simply too magnificent, too mesmerizing. Here, Varda's signature mix of aesthetic innovation and generosity of emotion results in a surreal and captivating essay on Art, Fame, Love, Children and Staircases. For its first-ever U.S. theatrical release the film has been newly-restored from the original 35mm camera negative, overseen by director Varda herself.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093295/?ref_=sr_i_382,['Agn√®s Varda'],['Agn√®s Varda'],"['Jane Birkin', 'Jean-Pierre L√©aud', 'Philippe L√©otard', 'Farid Chopel', 'Alain Souchon', 'Serge Gainsbourg', 'Laura Betti', 'Monique Godard', 'Ian Marshall', 'Les enfants Tooke']",,,"$10,825",,"March 2, 1988",['France'],"['Rue Daguerre, Paris 14, Paris, France (Bakery Slapstick Scene)']","['Cin√©-tamaris', 'La Sept Cin√©ma']",,"['Biography', 'Fantasy']","['French', 'English', 'Spanish', 'Italian']"
