After Prima's manager, Marty Moran, brusquely informs them that Prima is busy on the day of the bazaar, Dorothy, angry at getting the ""brush off,"" confronts Prima with her request. When Marty rudely dismisses her once again, Dorothy waits in the lobby for the audition to end. After having run through a disappointing roster of singers, Prima apologizes to Dorothy for Marty's behavior and agrees to entertain at the bazaar. Bolstered by Prima's appearance, the bazaar raises over $3,000 for the summer camp. In gratitude, Dorothy invites Prima to dinner, during which she introduces him to her devoted young brother Buzz. When a neighbor drops by to ask Dorothy to babysit, Dorothy sings the infant to sleep, impressing Prima with her sweet voice. While washing the dishes, Dorothy hums a tune, prompting Prima to offer her the vocalist job, but she refuses. The next day, when Dorothy goes to the theater to ask Prima to join the church fund-raising committee, Marty insists that she sing before Prima gives her his answer. When Prima begins to coach Dorothy during her audition, the band breaks into laughter and Prima realizes that they have created an irresistible comedy routine. As Dorothy achieves prominence with the band, Buzz begins to feel neglected. One night, Buzz sees Prima kiss Dorothy and reacts with a jealous tantrum.

The Björndal patriarch Dag Sr., scarred in the face during a bear kill, has two sons: his fierce first-born favorite Tore shares his love for taunting the von Galls, while the gentle Dag Jr. rather enjoys the silence of the forest. When Tore seems to court the equally proud and stubborn Elisabeth von Gall, she makes her military suitor Lt. Margas challenge him to a duel- Tore, armed only with his coach whip, is pierced by his saber and his corps carried away by the river; now Elisabeth turns away from him. Even a month later Dag Sr. refuses to believe the missing Tore must be dead. Hunting the last bear, Dag Jr. loses his rifle and is badly wounded killing the beast with his knife; Adelheid and her father, retired royal guards Major Barre, friends of the von Galls, witness this, bring him home and are invited to stay at Björndal, where Adelheid nurses him and slips out Tore's fate to Dag Sr.; she and Dag Jr. fall in love. Even when her father confesses the mortgaged castle estate is near financial ruin, Elisabeth refuses to consider finding a rich husband as Margas, who just died, could have been. At Christmas, Dag Sr. invites Adhelheid to stay indefinitely, and she persuades him to attend church for the first time since the death of his wife Thérèse, 20 years earlier- there he springs the lovers to marry. In Spring Dag Sr. has a major wood contract for the English mines, which can only be fulfilled with the castle's cooperation; the von Galls finally learn the Björndals have bought all their debts. Elisabeth refuses the logs customary passage by the river trough the castle estate so father Björndal chooses, at great expense and inhuman effort, to create an alternative route, even if it kills a workman to Dag Jr. disgust which even makes him leave to become a sailor, and forecloses on the castle- the proud Elisabeth rather sets fire to it and burns in it. Only the next Christmas Dag Sr. learns from von Gall that Elisabeth secretly loved Tore; trying to reach his meanwhile returned son and Adelheid, the old man catches a fatal cold in the snow, and dies after learning he has a newborn grandson, Tore.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0053393/?ref_=sr_i_510,"['Trygve Gulbranssen', 'Kurt Heuser']",['Paul May'],"['Gert Fröbe', 'Hansjörg Felmy', 'Joachim Hansen', 'Carl Lange', 'Anna Smolik', 'Hans Nielsen', 'Maj-Britt Nilsson', 'Elisabeth Epp', 'Jürgen Goslar', 'Hanns Ernst Jäger']",,,,,"September 15, 1959",['Austria'],['Norway'],['Wiener Mundus-Film'],"Awards, 1 nomination total",['Drama'],['German']
