Overpowered by weakness, the coward sidesteps the obligations that love affairs impose: rather than living up to his dates he takes his sports-car from an ultra-modern garage and speeds to the fashionable beaches of Deauville. On his way, he is fatally hit by a descending swallow. The film is divided into three segments each of which consists of events the woman experienced. These sequences are embedded in scenes in which each of the three women is telling and casting her mind back to her own love affair. Thus, present, future and past merge and cannot be distinguished clearly. The intertwinement of several layers of time experience, recollection, telling and showing have been regarded as a source of inspiration of Alain Resnais and this film prefigures his ""L'Année dernière à Mariënbad"" to a certain extent.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0017938/?ref_=sr_i_51,"['Jean Epstein', 'Paul Morand']",['Jean Epstein'],"['Jeanne Helbling', 'Suzy Pierson', 'Olga Day', 'Raymond Guérin-Catelain', 'Jean Garat', 'René Ferté']",,,,,"November 22, 1927",['France'],"[""L'Isle-Adam, Val-d'Oise, France""]",['Films Jean Epstein'],,"['Drama', 'Romance']","['None', 'French']"

After building his own doesn't go so well, he winds up enlisting in the Army. During basic training, Monty falls in love with the Colonel's daughter (played by a young Jean Arthur), tangles with a mean drill sergeant (Kewpie Morgan) and is mistaken for a visiting French dignitary. But eventually Monty winds up in a plane and wins the big Army-Navy air polo match! On May 20, 1927 Charles Lindbergh successfully performed the first transatlantic solo flight, captivating the nation, if not the world. Two months later, motion picture trade papers announced that comedian Monty Banks' next feature-length comedy would be An Ace in the Hole -- which was released on December 5, 1927 as Flying Luck. This aviation-inspired comedy was the last produced of a string of Monty Banks features made 1924-27. Monty Banks entered films in 1916 and, after supporting other comedians for a few years, had a successful series of starring shorts from 1920 to 1924. Banks is probably best known for the climactic reels of his thrill comedy feature Play Safe (1927), which were featured in Robert Youngson's compilation movie The Days of Thrills and Laughter (1961). Flying Luck capitalizes on the 1927 airplane craze and co-stars a young Jean Arthur (Easy Living, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, Shane). This extremely rare silent film has never been available on home video, and is seen here in a transfer from a rare, vintage 35mm nitrate print.

She has a very soft spot in her heart for the Crown Prince Alexis who will eventually succeed her. Alexis is a hefty laughing cavalier who is an all-round sport and the finest shot in the country. Alexis has been officially betrothed to the Princess Elena of Avonia by the old queen. He has never seen her, nor has anyone else in the country besides the old queen. One day the news comes that the Princess is staying at Castle Anuscheff, just like an ordinary school girl on a vacation. The minister informs Alexis that he must go to the castle to pay the Princess a formal visit. The Prince sends his aide, Dimitri, to the castle with a letter announcing his impending visit. The next day, Dimitri rides out through the country. Near the castle he sees a wonderful looking girl riding on horseback. He is instantly smitten by her and tries to race with her. Not succeeding in out-distancing her, he pretends to fall from his horse. The dark-haired beauty turns around at his cry of distress and returns to help him. He stands upright, looks at her and says, ""thanks; your eyes are really brown-that's all I wanted to know."" The girl, nettled by the impertinence, whips up her horse and gallops off. Arrived at the castle Dimitri sends in the letter from the Crown Prince. He is presented to two girls, one a blonde and the other a brunette. The brunette is the one with whom he tried to flirt in the forest and she is announced as the Princess Elena. Her blonde friend is the Countess Vera Anuscheff. Dimitri feels that he is falling in love with the officially announced bride of the Crown Prince. The Crown Prince arrives and they hold an informal dance. Dimitri sweeps the Princess off her feet with an impassioned declaration of his love. The Prince who has been dancing with the little blonde has seen nothing of what has occurred and he suggests a sleigh ride. He makes Dimitri, drive the blonde while he takes as his partner, the little brunette. A terrific snow storm arises and the Prince's sled overturns. As they are quite close to the inn, the Prince takes the blonde there; they go to his private rooms. After a moment, the Prince comes up with a warm drink for her and tries to calm her. She bursts out with ""I'm worried about the Princess Elena."" The Crown Prince is mystified; she rattles on. ""I'm not the Princess. I'm Countess Vera Anuscheff. The Princess was so nervous about meeting you for the first time, that we changed names for one day and this is what has happened."" In the Castle Anuscheff a similar explanation is taking place. Dimitri realizes that the girl whom he loves is not the princess and that she is lost somewhere in the snow storm. He drives hurriedly off. The Prince who is angry at being fooled tries to make love to Vera. She puts up a fight but the Prince is relentless. Dimitri enters in time to save her and she cries to be taken away. Dimitri challenges the Prince to a duel but the Prince has him put under arrest. Next day Dimitri is condemned to death. The Princess on learning the story from Vera, pleads with the Prince to grant a respite. He agrees to give one hour of freedom on Dimitri's promise to return promptly. Vera. persuades him to run away and he is torn between his love and his word of honor. In the Castle, the Princess turns on the Prince and accuses him of having played the part of the coward. Vera enters and tells them that Dimitri has run away. The Prince sneers and Dimitri walks in, confessing that he could not go back on his word. The Crown Prince offers to duel Dimitri, and pistols are chosen. Dimitri flings off his coat and removes a cigarette case from his breast pocket. This is the case that the Prince had given him for having saved his life. Dimitri will not use it as a shield and he removes It. Alexis follows the gesture and repents. The Prince shoots but only hits the pendulum on the clock. The sentence is revoked and the picture ends with Dimitri and Vera dancing their way thru the dark and empty ball room, to the strain of their waltz which is played for them by an old violinist, who is on his way home.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0317873/?ref_=sr_i_491,"['Julius Brammer', 'Alfred Grünwald', 'Alice Miller']",['Arthur Robison'],"['Liane Haid', 'Willy Fritsch', 'Suzy Vernon', 'Hans Adalbert Schlettow', 'Fritz Rasp', 'Sophie Pagay', 'Ida Wüst', 'Fritz Eckert', 'Elsie Vanya', 'John Loder']",,,,,"September 23, 1927",['Germany'],,['Universum Film (UFA)'],,"['Drama', 'Romance']","['None', 'German']"
