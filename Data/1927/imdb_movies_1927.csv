After building his own doesn't go so well, he winds up enlisting in the Army. During basic training, Monty falls in love with the Colonel's daughter (played by a young Jean Arthur), tangles with a mean drill sergeant (Kewpie Morgan) and is mistaken for a visiting French dignitary. But eventually Monty winds up in a plane and wins the big Army-Navy air polo match! On May 20, 1927 Charles Lindbergh successfully performed the first transatlantic solo flight, captivating the nation, if not the world. Two months later, motion picture trade papers announced that comedian Monty Banks' next feature-length comedy would be An Ace in the Hole -- which was released on December 5, 1927 as Flying Luck. This aviation-inspired comedy was the last produced of a string of Monty Banks features made 1924-27. Monty Banks entered films in 1916 and, after supporting other comedians for a few years, had a successful series of starring shorts from 1920 to 1924. Banks is probably best known for the climactic reels of his thrill comedy feature Play Safe (1927), which were featured in Robert Youngson's compilation movie The Days of Thrills and Laughter (1961). Flying Luck capitalizes on the 1927 airplane craze and co-stars a young Jean Arthur (Easy Living, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, Shane). This extremely rare silent film has never been available on home video, and is seen here in a transfer from a rare, vintage 35mm nitrate print. BONUS: This DVD includes 40 minutes of newsreels covering Lucky Lindy's infamous flight from New York to Paris from ""weeklies"" (newsreels) produced by Kinograms, the William J.

Alexis has been officially betrothed to the Princess Elena of Avonia by the old queen. He has never seen her, nor has anyone else in the country besides the old queen. One day the news comes that the Princess is staying at Castle Anuscheff, just like an ordinary school girl on a vacation. The minister informs Alexis that he must go to the castle to pay the Princess a formal visit. The Prince sends his aide, Dimitri, to the castle with a letter announcing his impending visit. The next day, Dimitri rides out through the country. Near the castle he sees a wonderful looking girl riding on horseback. He is instantly smitten by her and tries to race with her. Not succeeding in out-distancing her, he pretends to fall from his horse. The dark-haired beauty turns around at his cry of distress and returns to help him. He stands upright, looks at her and says, ""thanks; your eyes are really brown-that's all I wanted to know."" The girl, nettled by the impertinence, whips up her horse and gallops off. Arrived at the castle Dimitri sends in the letter from the Crown Prince. He is presented to two girls, one a blonde and the other a brunette. The brunette is the one with whom he tried to flirt in the forest and she is announced as the Princess Elena. Her blonde friend is the Countess Vera Anuscheff.
