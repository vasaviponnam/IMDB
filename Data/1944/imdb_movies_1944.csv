"295. Roger Touhy, Gangster",1944,1h 5m,Approved,6.8,78,,"In 1931, Captain Steven Warren, the chief investigator for the Chicago District Attorney's office, tries to arrest the henchmen of notorious gangster and bootlegger Roger Touhy for a series of crimes, but the frightened witnesses refuse to cooperate. Warren releases Touhy's cohorts--Herman ""Owl"" Banghart, Bernard ""Troubles"" O'Connor, Icebox Hamilton, Maxie Sharkey and Thomas J. ""Smoke"" Reardon--from custody but vows to pursue them. In Dec 1933, after Prohibition is repealed, Touhy decides to go ""straight"" because he is tired of pressure from Warren and the police. Needing money to buy a brewery, Touhy asks businessman Joseph P. Sutton to repay the $200,000 that he owes him. Although Sutton has the money, he claims that he does not, and his partner, Edward Latham, advises him to stall Touhy. Fed up with waiting, Touhy and his men kidnap Sutton and eventually collect $70,000 ransom from Latham. After Sutton is released, Warren pressures him to identify Touhy's gang as the kidnappers, and the reluctant businessman finally does so, although he does not reveal his prior connections to Touhy. While Touhy and his men are leaving the area, they are involved in a minor automobile accident that leads to their arrest. During their trial, Smoke testifies against Touhy and the others, who are found guilty and sent to serve ninety-nine-year sentences in the Stateville Peniteniary at Joliet, Illinois. Touhy is infuriated by Smoke's betrayal, and as the next eight years pass, continually tries to obtain a new trial. Smoke, who has been in hiding, is caught by some of Touhy's followers on the outside and framed for a crime he did not commit. Smoke is then sent to the penitentiary, and after being terrorized by Touhy, agrees to recant his testimony and help to free the gang. Smoke is killed by another prisoner before he can talk, however, and a desperate Touhy plans to escape from the prison. With the help of a prison guard, Touhy and his cellmate, George Carroll, escape along with Owl, Troubles, Icebox, Maxie and Rowden, another prisoner. Because the United States is now involved in the war, Touhy knows that the men will be arrested if they are caught without draft cards, and so orders Carroll and Rowden to rob unsuspecting citizens of their cards. The Federal Bureau of Investigation then takes over the case, as Touhy and his men have violated the Selective Service Act, first by not notifying the draft board of their ""change of address,"" and then through their theft of the draft cards. Maxie's drunken carelessness causes Touhy to beat him viciously, and after Maxie and Icebox leave the gang, Icebox is arrested and informs the police of Touhy's whereabouts. Soon after, Rowden and Carroll are killed when F.B.I. agents attempt to apprehend them. Working with Warren, the F.B.I. then surrounds the apartment where Touhy, Troubles and Owl are living, and Owl convinces Touhy to surrender quietly, telling him that it is now time to pay for being on top for so long. Touhy and his men are then returned to Joliet.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0036846/?ref_=sr_i_295

The exquisite crafts made by different artisans are presented, and the journey then continues down through Africa along the Niger River. Across to the East, near Lake Chad, a wedding ceremony is celebrated, and then, to the South, along the Ubangi River, villagers live together in peace and harmony. The process of ritual scarification is demonstrated to the expedition members, and then, in another village, the King of the Watusi watches as his subjects dance and play musical instruments. Later, in the Belgian Congo, a ""white hunter"" leads the search for an adolescent elephant, which is captured for domestication. The expedition then follows the route of convoys carrying military men and supplies across the Indian Ocean to Bombay, where cows, which are considered sacred, wander through the streets. India is a country of many religions and different ideologies, including the Hindu who believe that the holy Ganges River will enable one's soul to go directly to heaven if one's ashes are scattered into it. In another part of India, Hindu men atone for their sins by inserting silver skewers and pins into their faces and bodies. In Ceylon, where powerful Allied sea-bases maintain their strongholds against Japanese forces, women artisans make lace, as they were taught by the Dutch. Then, ""devil dancers"" rehearse for the annual festival in which hundreds of pilgrims and special elephants march in a procession on the way to a shrine containing a sacred tooth of Buddha. Other Buddhists live and worship in Rangoon, Burma, which is home to many other interesting and unusual peoples. Teak, the hardest and most precious of tropical woods, is harvested in Burma with the help of elephants, which are specifically bred for the work due to the declining numbers of wild elephants. High in the mountains, hermit priests explain that there are still believers in the ancient legend of a snake god who was conquered by a mortal woman. The explorers leading the expedition travel to the small village of Kenzi, where only priestesses are allowed to tend to the living king cobras that are the embodiment of Naga, the snake god of fertility. After anointing herself with a sacred powder, a priestess lures a cobra out of his cave and then kisses his head three times to prove her domination over the dangerous creature. Despite the fact that two of her comrades have been killed during the ritual, the priestess shows no fear and accomplishes her goal. The explorers then make their way back to their companions and realize that, just as American soldiers are becoming familiar with the varied wonders of the world, so must ordinary citizens have respect for other cultures if war is to be prevented from breaking out again.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2282749/?ref_=sr_i_344

348. The Unwritten Code,1944,1h 1m,Approved,6.3,55,,"When an Allied prisoner of war ship transporting a cargo of German prisoners is torpedoed by a German submarine in the North Atlantic, three survivors cling for their lives to a raft. The three are German prisoners of war Corporal Karl Richter, Private Heinrich Krause and British interpreter Roland Cheever. Cheever, who was wounded in the explosion, is vulnerable and defenseless, and so the predatory Richter decides to assume his identity. After stripping the helpless Cheever of his uniform and identity papers, Richter dumps his body into the sea. Some time later, Richter and Krause are rescued by a passing ship, and Richter awakens in a hospital near the Midland Prisoner of War Camp. The papers found on his body identify Richter as Cheever, and so the hospital staff assumes that he is a British soldier and ally. Richter recuperates from his injuries, but because he still suffers from an injured right arm, his nurse, Mary Lee Norris, invites him to convalesce at her family's farm, Shady Acres. When Mary Lee's fiance, Terry Hunter, a sergeant at the internment camp, learns of the Norris' new boarder, he becomes jealous. One day, Mary Lee's younger brother Willie and his friend, Dutchy Schultz, are playing with a BB gun. Richter takes an interest in the boys' activities upon discovering that Dutchy's father owns a store that sells guns. After demonstrating his marksmanship by shooting a bird from a tree, Richter goes to the garage to ask Mary Lee for a ride to town. There, he embraces her against her will, and she has to struggle to free herself. While the two drive to town, Richter asks to stop at the internment camp, and although he is forbidden to speak to the prisoners, he spots Krause among them. In town, Richter visits Schultz's store, and after observing the inventory of guns, he buys a map of the area. When Richter returns home, Mary Lee presents him with a telegram ordering him to report to the British Consul so that arrangements can be made for his return to England. While Richter studies his message, Willie calls Terry aside and tells him about Richter's two-armed attack on Mary Lee, causing Terry to become suspicious because Richter's right arm was supposed to be injured. Soon after, a call comes notifying Terry of the escape of one of the prisoners of war. Richter retires to his room, and as he studies the map, he hears a tapping at the window and sees Krause outside. Informing Krause of his plan to free the German prisoners and arm them, Richter orders him to hide in the barn and await further instructions. That night, Richter accompanies Terry and the Norrises to a benefit concert for the Red Cross, in which Mary Lee is to play the piano. After the adults leave, Willie recruits Dutchy to help search Richter's room. When they reach the concert hall, Richter decides to wait outside, and Terry, his suspicions aroused, places a call to the British Consul. After the performance begins, Richter drives back to the barn, picks up Krause and proceeds to Schultz's store. The Germans steal all of Schultz's rifles, and hide them in the barn. The boys are still searching Richter's room when they hear his footsteps and hide under the bed. After retrieving a pistol from his suitcase, Richter drives off, and the boys emerge from his room and see Krause hiding in the barn. When they discover the German's discarded prisoner of war uniform, Willie sends Dutchy to town for help. Richter is waiting outside the concert hall when Dutchy comes running in, yelling about a nest of Nazis. Richter immediately drives away and is soon followed by Terry and the other members of the town. Arriving at the barn first, Richter finds Willie, knocks him unconscious and then shoots Krause. After the others appear, Richter claims he shot the Nazi to save Willie. When Dutchy tells of Richter's earlier return to the house, the German asserts that he came back to retrieve Mary Lee's sheet music. Excusing himself to go to his room, Richter sneaks out the back, loads the guns in the car and drives toward the internment camp. Terry and the military police are waiting for him in the woods, however, and deflect his progress with a hail of gunfire. Pulling Richter from the car, Terry exposes him as a Nazi and informs him that the British Consul sent a picture of the real Cheever. With the Nazi menace eradicated, the townsfolk return to their idyllic life.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0037419/?ref_=sr_i_348

Instead, the Russians were given massive upheavals in society and economy and in 1922, 114 revolutionaries were put on trial for crimes against the Soviet government. Lenin's death in January, 1924, led to a funeral attended by thousands and the takeover by Joseph Stalin. U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt established diplomatic relations with the Soviets. German footage and newsreels chronicle the German invasion of Russia, from the Battle of Leningrad to the destruction of Kharkov to the Battle of Rostov on 22 November 1941. Further footage reveals the disaster of Lidice in occupied Czechoslovakia and the siege of Sevastopol in the Crimea. When the Russians finally drive the Germans out of Rostov, Iran becomes a focal point.

After her sudden departure, she eventually learns that Garth had lost his sight in a hunting accident. Furthermore, pretty Paulina has no interest in marrying a blind man. Without disclosing her true identity, Juana discreetly returns to care for the man she loves.

Though Parker stirs the town's interest by using a fake divining rod to prove that there is oil in Pine Ridge, Lum believes that Parker is trying to underbid them, and sends a warning to Pine Ridge land owners not to sell to him. Among those taking heed of Lum's warning is Abigail, who has been in love with Lum for many years and wants to marry him. Leading the effort to exploit the town's supposed oil reserves, Lum organizes the Pine Ridge Oil and Development Co. and holds a town meeting to persuade the residents to begin drilling the oil themselves.

Attired in raincoats to guard against spewing oil, the entire town anxiously awaits the explosion that promises to bring the oil gush. The explosion, however, results in nothing more than disappointment, as it is quickly determined that there is no oil to be found below the surface.

600. Marked Trails,1944,58m,Approved,6.3,82,,"Following completion of the ""Trail Blazers"" series, Bob Steele and Hoot Gibson were paired in three other Monogram westerns, with the only connection to the ""Trail Blazers"" series being Steele and Gibson in the cast and production and distribution by Monogram, with various Monogram people serving as production supervisors i.e., William Strobach on this entry and Victor Hammond on the other two. This one finds Jack Slade (Mauritz Hugo) and Mary Conway,alias Blanche (Veda Ann Borg), being recognized as known and wanted crooks by deputy marshal Harry Stevens (Steve Clark) and, when he orders them out of town, Slade kills him. His son, Bob Stevens (Bob Steele) and friend Parkford (Hoot Gibson) become U.S. Marshals and proceed to rid the town of the cut-throat gang that has been terrorizing the citizens. Bob goes undercover as an outlaw and works his way into the gang, while Hoot poses as a Dude who goes about making fiery speeches on behalf of law and order. The Gibson role here is limited in the action scenes to none, as he and his Monogram stunt double, Ben Corbett, were both getting a bit long in the tooth for such, and the nominal second lead was played by a relative newcomer to the screen, Ralph Lewis (II) as a good guy/bad guy outlaw, who is not the same as the older Ralph Lewis (I) who was making films in the 30's. Rule of thumb here for those who don't know what either one looks like is that any Ralph Lewis credit in the 1930's belongs to (I) and any occurring circa 1943-47 belongs to (II).",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0037050/?ref_=sr_i_600
