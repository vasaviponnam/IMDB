352. Generation Found,2016,1h 25m,Not Rated,8.6,19,,"GENERATION FOUND is a powerful story about one community coming together to ignite a youth addiction recovery revolution in their hometown. Devastated by an epidemic of addiction, Houston faced the reality of burying and locking up its young people at an alarming rate. And so in one of the largest cities in America, visionary counselors, law school dropouts, aspiring rock musicians, retired football players, oil industry executives, and church leaders came together to build the world's largest peer-driven youth and family recovery community. Independently filmed over the course of two years, GENERATION FOUND takes an unprecedented and intimate look at how a system of treatment centers, sober high schools, alternative peer groups, and collegiate recovery programs can exist in concert to intervene early and provide a real and tested long-term alternative to the ""War on Drugs.""

418. Trapped,2016,1h 30m,Not Rated,7.2,273,77.0,"From 2011 to 2013, hundreds of regulations were passed restricting access to abortion in America. Reproductive rights advocates refer to these as ""TRAP"" laws, or Targeted Regulation of Abortion Providers. While these laws have been enacted in 11 states, Southern clinics, in particular have been hit hardest and are now in a fight for survival. In Texas, less than half of the clinics open in 2013 are still functioning. In Alabama, three clinics struggle to keep their doors open. And in Mississippi, just one abortion clinic remains. Some of the most common requirements with which clinics struggle to comply include: requiring physicians to obtain admitting privileges from local hospitals for any doctor performing abortions, requiring that clinics undertake expensive renovations such as widening hallways by a few inches to accommodate wheelchairs and gurneys they will rarely use, and requiring other regulations usually reserved for hospitals even though abortion providers rarely require such a high level of care. But even in this hostile environment the doctors, clinic owners and staff refuse to give up. Trapped interweaves the personal stories behind these regulatory battles: from the physician who crisscrosses the country assuring medical services are available; to the strong women and men who run the clinics; to the lawyers leading the legal charge to eliminate these laws; to the women they are all determined to help. In this feature length character driven film, our main characters fight alongside a dedicated cadre of attorneys to preserve abortion rights in a country living with the mistaken belief that Roe v. Wade still protects a woman's right to choose.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5259692/?ref_=sr_i_418,"['Sari Gilman', 'Dawn Porter']",['Dawn Porter'],"['June Ayers', 'Andrea Ferrigno', 'Gloria Gray', 'Dalton Johnson', 'Bethany Milton', 'Nancy Northup', 'Willie Parker']",,"$17,626","$63,241","$63,241","January 24, 2016",['United States'],,"['Big Mouth Productions', 'Cedar Creek Productions', 'Trilogy Films']","Awards, 3 wins & 5 nominations total",['Documentary'],['English']

Rolling Stone investigative reporter Greg Palast busted Jeb Bush for stealing the 2000 election by purging Black voters from Florida's electoral rolls. Now Palast is back to take a deep dive into the Republicans' dark operation, Crosscheck, designed to steal a million votes by November. Crosscheck is controlled by a Trump henchman, Kris Kobach, Kansas Secretary of State who claims his computer program has identified 7.2 million people in 29 states who may have voted twice in the same election--a felony crime. The catch? Most of these ""suspects"" are minorities-in other words, mainly Democratic voters. Yet the lists and the evidence remain ""confidential."" Palast and his investigative partner Leni Badpenny do what it takes to get their hands on the data, analyzing it to find the names of nearly one million Americans about to lose their vote by November. They hunt down and confront Kobach with the evidence of his ""lynching by laptop."" Then they are off to find the billionaires behind this voting scam. The search takes Palast from Kansas to the Arctic, the Congo, and to a swanky Hamptons dinner party held by Trump's sugar-daddy, John Paulson, a.k.a. ""JP The Foreclosure King."" Palast and BadpennyThey stake out top GOP donors, the billionaire known as ""The Vulture"" and the Koch brothers, whom Palast nails with a damning tape recording. In this real life detective story brought to life in a film noir style with cartoon animation, secret documents, hidden cameras, and a little help from Law & Order: Special Victims Unit detectives, Ice-T and Richard Belzer, Shailene Woodley, Rosario Dawson, Willie Nelson and Ed Asner, Palast and his associates expose the darkest plans of the uber-rich to steal America's democracy.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5347158/?ref_=sr_i_483,['Greg Palast'],"['Greg Palast', 'David Ambrose']","['Edward Asner', 'Richard Belzer', 'Rosario Dawson', 'Von Eckardt-Manzoni', 'Ice-T', 'Robert F.

499. Disturbing the Peace,2016,1h 27m,Not Rated,7.5,286,81.0,"In a world torn by conflict -in a place where the idea of peace has been abandoned-an energy of determined optimism emerges. When someone is willing to disturb the status quo and stand for the dream of a free and secure world, who will stand with them? DISTURBING THE PEACE is a story of the human potential unleashed when we stop participating in a story that no longer serves us and, with the power of our convictions, take action to create new possibilities. DISTURBING THE PEACE follows former enemy combatants - Israeli soldiers from elite units and Palestinian fighters, many of whom served years in prison - who have joined together to challenge the status quo and say ""enough."" The film reveals their transformational journeys from soldiers committed to armed battle to nonviolent peace activists, leading to the creation of Combatants for Peace. While based in the Middle East, DISTURBING THE PEACE evokes universal themes relevant to us all and inspires us to become active participants in the creation of our world.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5503512/?ref_=sr_i_499,"['Chen Alon', 'Jamil Qassas', 'Avner Wishnitzer']","['Stephen Apkon', 'Andrew Young']","['Chen Alon', 'Jamil Qassas', 'Avner Wishnitzer', 'Sulaiman Khatib', 'Mohammed Owedah', 'Shifa Qudsi', 'Assaf Yacobovitz', 'Maia Hescal', 'Fatima Qassas', 'Lara Qassas']",,"$10,907","$25,287","$25,287","March 10, 2016","['Israel', 'Occupied Palestinian Territory', 'United States']",,"['Reconsider', 'Archipelago Films']","Awards, 6 wins total",['Documentary'],['English']
