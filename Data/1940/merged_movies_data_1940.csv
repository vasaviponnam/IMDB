There he finds that the club is insolvent and that the performers are demanding their salaries. Pappy suggests that they come to Farmdale to work for their wages, and when the performers learn of the plight of the orphanage, they offer to stage a show to recoup the shortage in funds.

To invalidate the ordinance, the orphans set fire to a haystack, and as the fire engines speed toward the fire, the youngsters chop down the bridge, stranding the trucks at the barn. The presence of the fire trucks offsets the fire hazard, and the show goes on.

When she at great risk catches a vulture's young from its nest she carries the respect of her father, but also the scorn of Bear-Jospeh, assistant hunter to the local squire. He mocks her as ""Geierwally"" (Vulture-Wally), as he thinks young women shouldn't wear pants and climb around in the mountains hunting. What he doesn't yet know is that Wally is almost mad with love for him - and too stiff with pride to admit the slightest idea of that.

Now, J.H. and Polly are 50/50 partners in developing the mine which both believe contains copper.

With the mansion required to pay off his debts, they decide the whole lot of them, including J.H., Jasper and who will soon be their unpaid butler, the sentimental and loyal Martin, will move back into the Pepper's tiny house in Gusky Corners, and Mrs. Pepper will get her old job back at the overall factory.

Ma and the gang go on a crime spree across the states, receiving $300,000 in ransom for kidnapping, and additional cash from various robberies. Aware that the serial numbers on the ransom money have been recorded by federal agents, they arrange with fellow crook Pan to trade the money $100,000 in unmarked bills, but take the bills and kill him instead, They are unaware, however, that the police have found a list of the serial numbers for all Pan's bills in his coat pocket. Federal agents Scott Langham and Ross Waring are put on the case, and trace the Websters to a Southern town, where Ma is posing as a socialite. The Websters elude the police, but are forced to live meagerly while hiding out in cheap hotels. By the next Christmas, Ma returns to Centre City to visit Bert's baby boy. While she is out, her boys hold up a store, but Charlie is killed and Tom is arrested. Bert represents Tom at his extradition trial, and convinces him to plead guilty and return willingly to the city of the kidnapping. When George wants to go his own way, Ma and Eddie kill him, then hire Stitch Torey to get Tom away from the police. Their attempt fails, however, and most of Torey's gang perish. After a year, Ma and Eddie have developed a low profile while Eddie works at a cannery to support them, and Ma becomes neighborly. Unknown to Ma, Eddie arranges a hideout for some robbers he hopes to join up with and gives them a case of canned food, but the criminals' car crashes and the police get Eddie's fingerprints from the cans. On Christmas Eve, federal agents attempt to arrest Ma and Eddie, who respond with gunfire. In the hail of bullets, Eddie is killed and Ma is finally arrested.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0032958/?ref_=sr_i_380,"['Horace McCoy', 'William R. Lipman', 'J. Edgar Hoover']",['James P.

Even though the police attest that Brod is a New York City police detective, Ann remains dubious and consequently follows Brod when he visits the Dumeray gallery. At the gallery, Brod asks Leon Dumeray to store a painting in his vault. Recognizing the canvas as stolen, Dumeray has Brod arrested. Her interest piqued, Ann visits Brod in jail where he asks her to bring him some fruit from Juan's fruit stand. Ann returns with a pineapple, in which a gun is concealed. Holding Ann at gunpoint, Brod demands that she switch clothing with him and, thus disguised, he blasts his way out of jail. After his escape, the police congratulate Brod on his clever ruse of staging a jail break in order to win the Wildcat's confidence. Pretending to seek refuge, Brod breaks into Dumeray's home where the art dealer reveals that he is the real Wildcat and recruits Brod to join his gang. Learning of a planned robbery at the museum the following night, Brod passes a message, coded in a bar of soap, warning the police. Meanwhile, Ann discovers that Brod really is a police detective, and when she sees him at Dumeray's house, she assumes that the two are working together and unintentionally lets Dumeray know who Brad is. Dumeray then takes Brod, Ann and her driver Max prisoner and ties them up in the power house near the museum.

Anne appears to be no exception, for after her first glimpse of her desolate new surroundings, she states that she will be returning home the next morning. Before she leaves, however, she witnesses Jim and his Eskimo assistant Joe deliver Mrs. Bearfat Tillicoot's baby by a Caeserian section. Anne is deeply impressed by Jim's dedication as he use his own blood to give Mrs. Tillicoot a life-saving transfusion. That night, Joe's wife Koda pleads with Anne to stay, but she remains firm in her resolve, even though she is again impressed by Jim's kindness to his patients. She watches as he refuses payment from a miner, whose dying partner was able to end his life quickly with the drugs that Jim left for him to use if he wished. The next day, Anne is about to leave when U.S. Marshal Bill Bogler arrives with Ninimook, an Eskimo Bogler arrested for fur theft. During their struggle, Bogler had fractured Ninimook's skull, and he now demands that Jim save the man's life. Anne assists as Jim performs the dangerous brain surgery, but she leaves as Ninimook convalesces. After she is gone, Jim is needed to attend the Tillicoot baby, but is forced to stay with Ninimook. Jim warns Bogler that he will be held responsible if the Eskimo dies, but Ninimook soon recovers. As Bogler is praising Jim's surgical skill, he mentions a Dr. Gary Currier, a brilliant surgeon who fled Seattle five years earlier after being arrested for the euthanasic death of his terminally-ill father, who was also a prominent physician. Jim shrugs off Bogler's intimations, although he is in fact Currier, then goes to visit the Tillicoots. There he finds Anne, who, having chosen to say, has been tending the ill baby for two days. Jim is delighted to see her, and as the pair return to his house, their mutual attraction becomes obvious. When they arrive, Jim is forced to admit that he is Currier, and Bogler arrests him. Jim pleads with Anne to look after his patients until another doctor arrives, then leaves with Bogler. Joe and Anne follow them and help Jim escape with the aid of his lead sled dog, Blitzen. While Jim is in hiding, he reveals to Anne that his father committed suicide and that he accepted the blame in order to protect his father's reputation. Bogler is overcome by snow blindness while he is chasing Jim, and despite the danger to his own life and freedom, Jim tends to Bogler and restores his eyesight.

Barnett Company, get the contract to build Maylor bridge, because it means a pay raise for Joe. Joe's raise hinges upon Davis, the man in charge of bids for the city, accepting his estimate. To insure that Joe will get the raise, the Phillips invite Mr. Barnett to dinner. As Mary shops for the evening's festivities, she leaves Sandy in the charge of Billy Pepino, an unemployed construction foreman who lives next door. Billy, who has been fired as foreman on a Barnett building because Barnett considers him unlucky, is paid a visit by inventor Felix Lobo Smith, who has just developed a safety parachute for construction workers and hopes to sell it to Barnett. Billy accompanies Felix on a visit to Barnett's office, leaving Sandy in the care of his sons Mike and Pat, who take the toddler with them to perform in the streets. Sandy crawls into a restaurant, where Felix, who has been thrown out of Barnett's office, is working when gangsters Nick Case and Murph come to demand protection money from Henri, the owner of the restaurant. When Henri orders the gangsters to leave, they place a bomb in the cloak room. Meanwhile, Felix, who has just been fired, leaves Sandy in the care of the cloakroom girl, who notifies Officer Rafferty of the lost baby. Before Rafferty arrives, however, the bomb is found, and in the excitement, Sandy crawls away and climbs into a refuse truck. As Sandy is hauled around in the truck, Barnett's worthless nephew and his wife approach him for money. To win his sympathy, they tell him that they have a son, and he agrees to meet them at Henri's restaurant for lunch. The trash truck then returns to deposit Sandy at Henri's, where the nephew claims her. Barnett, touched, asks to take care of Sandy, and he takes her to the construction site, where she crawls into an elevator and shoots skyward. Felix and Billy, who have come looking for work, join Barnett in his effort to save Sandy, and when Barnett falls from one of the girders, Felix saves him with his parachute, thus proving the value of his invention. Billy then claims Sandy, but Barnett insists that the baby is his nephew's son and promises Billy a lifetime job if the baby is a girl. To settle the argument, Rafferty takes Sandy back to the station. When he gets waylaid chasing the gangsters, Sandy is found by Pat and Mike, who take her home. At dinner that night, Davis turns down the Barnett bid on the grounds that Joe has submitted the highest bid, but Sandy saves the day when she pulls some papers from Davis' pocket that prove that Joe submitted the lowest bid, thus winning the contract and his pay raise.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0033019/?ref_=sr_i_500,['Charles Grayson'],['Charles Lamont'],"['Baby Sandy', 'Billy Lenhart', 'Kenneth Brown', 'Eugene Pallette', 'Nan Grey', 'Tom Brown', 'Mischa Auer', 'Billy Gilbert', 'Edgar Kennedy', 'Fritz Feld']",,,,,"May 21, 1940",['United States'],"['Universal Studios - 100 Universal City Plaza, Universal City, California, USA (Studio)']",['Universal Pictures'],,['Comedy'],['English']

The Sagebrush Family Trails West,1940,59m,Approved,,,,"Begin with setting the record straight for those uninformed sources that insist on tagging this film as a Producers Releasing Corporation entry.

The PRC name did not yet exist when this film was made, nor does it appear on any of the prints or advertising connected with this film. Neufeld produced this one as the first of a proposed series of films featuring his B-western version of M-G-M's Hardy Family. Heading the cast was 13-year-old World's Champion Junior Cowboy named Bobby Clack, who was well known by that name so Neufeld, for reasons unknown since his use of Clack was to cash in on Clack's rodeo reputation (who had already appeared in two films as Bobby Clack), promptly changed his name to Bobby Clark. Go figure. The film has Bobby Sawyer, 13-year-old World's Champion Junior Cowboy and star of Sawyer's Greater Attractions medicine show, averting the robbery of a bank in Halfway, Texas and the impressed and grateful citizens induce Bobby's parents, Doc and Minerva Sawyer to settle in the town, over the protests of daughter Nellie, who is determined to drag them to the ""big city"" where she plans on becoming a great star of the theatre. Crafty Lem Gorman, editor of the town newspaper and secret ""brain"" behind the gang of robbers terrorizing the community, seeing Nellie's attraction for young deputy sheriff Jim Barton, sells the Sawyers a ranch which belongs to his lieutenant Bart Wallace.

Stony Brooke, Rusty Joslin and Rico are Texas Rangers unable to enter the territory known as the Panhandle as it is not part of the state, and lawlessness runs rampant there, under the guerrilla leader, King Barton. They discover a young boy, Danny Burke, wounded and left to die by the Barton gang. They nurse him back to health, but he is killed in another raid by the Barton outfit. Stony takes possession of the boy's gun and vows vengeance. Since the strip of land hiding the outlaws is under Federal authority, the Mesquiteers enter the territory with a plan to lure the outlaws across the Texas border. Stony, posing as his look-alike outlaw double known as The Laredo Kid, stages a jail break to free King Barton's younger brother Jim from a Texas jail and insinuates himself into the gang. Barton has been forcing a Panhandle gunsmith named Manners to provide weapons for him, and Manners' daughter, Doris, is antagonistic toward Stony, whom she believes to be The Laredo Kid. Stony soon convinces her of his true identity. The plot to lure the Barton gang into Texas is progressing nicely until the real Laredo Kid shows up and exposes Stony.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0032996/?ref_=sr_i_563,"['Barry Shipman', 'Earle Snell', 'J.
