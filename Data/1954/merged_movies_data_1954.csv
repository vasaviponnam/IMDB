Shelley Winters, after an absence of 15 months from the screen, is on the down-side of her sexpot days and the upside of her character days and is excellent as the devoted wife trying to keep her larcency-inclined husband on the up-and-up and has more losses than wins in that department; Kennan Wynn is even better as her fight-manager husband and gives a controlled performance as a blustery character, as opposed to the uncontrolled, mail-it-in, over-the-top blustery characters he later played in many westerns; and Earl Holliman as Wynn's harmonica-playing, punch-drunk handyman is dead on the mark. Story, which strays a bit toward the melodramatic in places, concerns a deacon's son,Daniel Norson(Dewey Martin), who thinks he has killed a man in a fight over a girl and goes on the lam. He is picked up by fight manager Willy Wurble (Keenan Wynn)and, since he owns a deadly punch, becomes a successful prize fighter. But his religious background leads him to refuse to take a dive in a fight Willy has fixed, even though he thinks Willy will turn him in on the murder charge. Creditability flies a little out of the window when Daniel discovers the man he is to fight is actually the man he thought he killed. Daniel's devoutness and faith has made Willy a semi-reformed sinner but that may be only because of lack of opportunity at the moment.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0047566/?ref_=sr_i_171,"['Art Cohn', 'Eustace Cockrell']",['Fred M.

340. Charge of the Lancers,1954,1h 13m,Approved,4.4,151,,"In 1856, at the height of the Crimean War, Turkish ally Great Britain sends munitions expert Maj. Bruce Lindsey with a model of its new, powerful cannon to British headquarters in Balaklava. After Capt. Eric Renault escorts Bruce through dangerous enemy territory to the fort, the major demonstrates the breech loading cannon's potential to Gen. Stanhope. Impressed, Stanhope immediately orders Bruce to return to London with a large order for the new weapon to fight against the impregnable Russian naval base at Fort Molokov in Sebastopol. Before leaving, Bruce briefly reunites with nurse Maria Sand, who puts off his proposal of marriage until the war's end. Shortly after his departure, Bruce is seized by Russian troops, who have been mysteriously tipped off as to the nature of his mission. When Stanhope learns of Bruce's capture, he summons Eric, whose experience in the French diplomatic corps he hopes will assist in negotiating Bruce's freedom. Along with Corp. Tim Daugherty, Eric sets off in search of Bruce, only to become trapped behind enemy lines when Stanhope is forced to withdraw his troops after a harsh Russian assault. Eric and Tim seek help from a caravan of traveling gypsies, musicians Asa and Keta and fortune-teller Tanya, who reluctantly agree to shelter them from a Russian patrol. That night when Russian corporal Bonikoff attempts to force himself on Tanya, Eric insists that not only is he her husband, but that Tanya is under the special protection of Russian general Boris Inderman. The following day, Bonikoff places the men in a cave outside the city of Sebastopol, and takes Tanya and Keta into Fort Molokov, where he presents them to Inderman. Inderman takes an immediate liking to Tanya and agrees to place the gypsies in a privileged cottage under his protection in exchange for the women's private attendance. Upon leaving Inderman's rooms, Tanya spots Bruce, beaten senseless, being escorted to the general by Dr. Manus. Manus reports to Inderman that Bruce has apparently suffered a mental collapse from the interrogation torture, but Inderman demands they continue to discover the details of Bruce's mission. Eric, Tim and Asa are forced to work for the Russians during their battles, but Eric uses the opportunity to study the fort's troop relief schedule. When Tanya reveals she saw a beaten British officer, Eric surmises it is Bruce and plots to find him. Meanwhile, acting on Dr. Manus' suggestion that Bruce might be shocked out of his stupor by a familiar face, Inderman sends a telegraph to Stanhope indicating that because the Russians are short of medical assistance, they will allow an English medical delegation to come to the fort to tend to their injured soldiers. Believing Eric is dead and viewing the offer as another opportunity to locate Bruce, Stanhope sends a contingent that includes Maria. Back at the fort, Eric asks Tanya to help him attend a large party thrown by Inderman the following night, and she coaches him on several fortune-teller tricks. At the party, Eric impresses Inderman and his guests, and the general wonders if Eric's talents are legitimate. Eric agrees to a test and when he outwits Inderman, the general takes him to Bruce, hoping Eric can read the dazed officer's mind. When Eric relates that Bruce's thoughts are jumbled but include a nurse and a cannon, Inderman is further convinced of Eric's mind-reading abilities and gives him full access to Bruce. When the British group arrives at Fort Mokolov, Maria, who is actually Inderman's spy, contacts Inderman, who hopes her presence will also assist in rousing Bruce. That night, Eric visits Bruce alone and learns that his friend has been shamming his stupor. When Maria visits Bruce, he asks her to take a message back to Stanhope detailing Eric's information of the troop change movements, which will provide a vital window for attack. Instead, Maria informs the men of her true loyalties before heading off to report to Inderman. Eric and Bruce attack the guard and race after Maria, and in the ensuing chase Maria is struck and killed by a runaway wagon. Eric asks Bruce to break into the telegraph office and send a coded message to Stanhope to begin an immediate bombardment, followed by a cavalry assault at the critical moment of the troop change at dawn. Eric then returns to Inderman's rooms for Tanya, and in the ensuing struggle, kills Inderman in a shootout. Eric and Tanya then outrace the British bombardment and meet Bruce and the others safely just as dawn breaks and the cavalry assault begins. After the successful destruction of Fort Molokov, Eric is presented with a medal of commendation and he and Tanya are married.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0046847/?ref_=sr_i_340,['Robert E.

But, in order to prevent a scandal, Angela urges Steve to get rid of the body without calling the police. Smitten Steve agrees and takes the body to his car with the intention of staging a crash. He is about to go do that when he finds out that Angela was indeed the lover of the dead man, and he hesitates. But a new character makes a violent entrance - a brutal ex-convict named Nino (Rossano Brazzi) - and he turns out to be Angela's husband. A fight ensues during which Nino gets hold of Steve's gun and shoots Bertolati's corpse, thereby implicating Steve, now less smitten with Angela than he was earlier, in the death of Bertolati. Nino then tries to kill Steve by pushing him into the car and into a nearby abyss, but Steve turns the tables and kills the aggressive Nino, hurling him into the car, with Bertolati, and into the abyss.

354. The Steel Cage,1954,1h 20m,Approved,6.4,50,,"Warden Clinton T. Duffy of San Quentin penitentiary introduces three short stories about prison life: Prisoner Billy Brenner, a gourmet, is dismayed to discover that Louis, the prison's head chef, is about to be paroled and offers him two hundred dollars a week to stay. However, Louis leaves and obtains a position as chef at a high-class restaurant where his girl friend Marie also works. One evening, a very particular customer visits the restaurant and Louis suggests a special dinner. When the customer is not totally pleased with the first course, Louis, who has a problem controlling his temper, manages to remain calm. After another course is rejected, Louis presents his coq-au-vin specialty whereupon the customer brings out a bottle of ketchup and slathers it over the dish. This enrages Louis, who then smashes a plate over the customer's head, thereby breaking not only the plate, but also the conditions of his parole. After Louis is returned to the prison, his assistant Solly tells him that a week before the incident in the restaurant occurred, he had heard that Louis would be coming back. Louis realizes that he has been framed by Brenner and his pals and deliberately prepares inedible meals for them. Meanwhile, Mrs. Duffy discovers that the restaurant customer was an ex-con and confidence man named Gilbert Lee, alias ""Phil the Hook,"" and tells her husband. Fed up with the poor food, a number of the convicts tell Louis that Brenner planned the whole thing. Louis then threatens Brenner with a meat cleaver and forces him to eat rice pudding covered with ketchup. Later, after Duffy informs Louis that his parole has been reinstated, he hands his chef's hat to Solly and leaves to meet Marie, as Lee joins the prisoners' ranks.

Warden Duffy's second story concerns an attempted prison break from an isolation area: One night, prisoner Chet Harmon feigns illness and Frank, a male orderly and prisoner, is summoned. Frank's brother Al, who is in an adjacent cell, tells Frank that he and Chet are planning a breakout and that he has to help. Frank is reluctant to assist as he just wants to serve his time and leave, but after a new prisoner sows doubts in Frank's mind about his girl friend's faithfulness, he decides to help. Later, while the prison doctor is examining Chet, Frank removes a gun from the doctor's medical bag and slips it into an unoccupied cell. When Frank is on his way out, he attacks a guard named Pete and is put in the cell where he placed the gun. With Al's help, Frank passes the gun to Chet. Another prisoner, Square, is also in on the escape. Three days later, when two members of the prison board, Garvey and Ferness, visit the cells on a routine inspection, Chet uses the gun to take Garvey and Pete prisoner and locks them in a cell. Chet then releases Al, Square and Frank and, using Ferness as a hostage, phones Duffy to demand that a car be delivered to the gate and that they be given a two-hour head start. When Duffy refuses to cooperate, Chet tells the warden that in ten minutes' time he will begin to kill the hostages. Frank wants nothing to do with killing, but while he and Al discuss this, Chet kills Pete and sends his body to Duffy. After Duffy reports to his chief, Square arranges that Duffy come, under a truce, to negotiate. Duffy tells Chet that his chief will be coming within two hours to make a deal. However, Chet then attempts to add Duffy to the hostages, prompting Square, who had given Duffy his word regarding the truce, to tackle Chet. Frank helps but is shot and seriously wounded by Chet, who then kills Square. Duffy says that Frank will die, but refuses to summon the doctor until they abandon the break. When Al, desperate to help his brother, goes to the phone to call the doctor, Chet threatens to shoot him, but Al draws a knife. Chet shoots him, but Al sinks the knife into Chet and they both die.

Duffy's final story is about a prisoner's need to find a purpose in life: When Duffy shows new prison chaplain Father Harvey around the chapel, the priest is saddened to see that a mural of ""The Last Supper"" has been damaged by rusty water pipes. After Shorty, a convict who is to assist Harvey, tells him that a prisoner named Steinberg, who is serving a life sentence for murdering his wife and her lover, is a very fine artist, Harvey persuades Steinberg to repair the mural. Access to the chapel is important to Shorty and his pal Mike as they plan to make bootleg liquor in an attic they can reach only from the chapel. Steinberg agrees to assist their project in return for a cut of the sales. Steinberg, who is an atheist and resents the priest's artistic supervision of his work, begins the restoration work with the face of Simon Peter. When Harvey discovers that the face Steinberg has given Simon Peter is that of a prisoner who was executed on the eve of Harvey's arrival, the priest accuses Steinberg of mocking religion and demands that he be disciplined and lose certain privileges for a week. Later, Steinberg discovers that Shorty and Mike are really planning a breakout via the attic and may take Harvey as a hostage. Steinberg resumes his work and finishes the face of Matthew. Meanwhile, Harvey is concerned about how he will deal with an imminent execution, and when he goes to Charlie Rivers' cell to hear his final confession, he realizes that Steinberg has given Matthew the condemned man's face. After Rivers tells Harvey that he is innocent and begs him to intervene, the priest talks with Duffy, who regrets that he is powerless and states that the horrible thing about capital punishment is that you never can be sure about guilt and innocence. This increases Harvey's anguish and, although he agrees to accompany Rivers to the execution chamber, he collapses on the way. Rivers then tells the priest that he is really guilty and seeks his help on his final journey. That night, Harvey tells Steinberg how Rivers helped him and admits that he has been prejudicial. Later, Shorty, who has become the model for the mural's Judas, Mike and Steinberg take Harvey hostage at gunpoint and attempt to break out. After Mike is killed by guards, Shorty has Harvey phone Duffy to arrange their release, but Duffy tells him that the guards have orders to shoot, regardless of who the hostage may be. Steinberg then tackles Shorty, refusing to permit the possible killing of the priest.

586. Ricochet Romance,1954,1h 20m,Approved,7.0,72,,"At the Flying ""W"" Ranch, emergency workers once again rescue owner Tom Williams from the fiery aftermath of one of his failed magic tricks. Tom's shenanigans are threatening the ranch's guest business, a subject of much concern to his grown daughter Betsy, young son Timmy and faithful employees, cousins Alfredo Gonzales Gonzales and Manuel Gonzales Gonzales. Alfredo and Manuel are happy to collect the new round of guests, pretty Angela Ann Mansfield, Mr. Worthington Higgenmacher, Mr. and Mrs. Harvey, Miss Clay and Mr. Webster, but as soon as the group reaches the ranch, Tom causes an explosion that prompts the cook to quit and the customers to decide to leave. Manuel offers to drive them to the airport, but along the way pretends that the car engine has failed, forcing the group to walk back to the ranch. He and Alfredo then visit an employment agency to hire a new cook. While practical Manuel hires Pansy Jones, a coarse woman with impeccable references, Alfredo has decided that Tom needs a wife to keep him busy and so chooses curvy Claire Renard, an actress with no domestic experience. All four of them return to the ranch, where Tom is immediately smitten with Claire, and Betsy despairs because Angela Ann has taken an interest in her boyfriend, cattle rancher Dave King. That night, Pansy's food so entrances the guests that they all agree to stay on, especially after Alfredo promises an exciting hunting expedition for the next day. Because there is no game in the area, however, Alfredo plants an electric crocodile, a moose head and several rabbits in the nearby fields. The inexperienced hunters spend the afternoon being frightened by the ""wild animals"" and narrowly avoiding shooting one another, and return to the ranch exhausted. Over the next few days, Tom repeatedly disappoints Timmy by canceling their plans in order to take Claire out. One night, Pansy tucks the boy in, and when Timmy reveals that Claire is urging Tom to sell the ranch and return to his old career in the rodeo, Pansy comforts him. She then turns to a distraught Betsy, who has turned her back on Dave after Angela Ann trapped him into taking her horseback riding, and convinces the young woman to use her own feminine wiles to win him back. Soon after, Claire plans a fiesta Fourth of July party and enlists Alfredo and Manuel to perform a Mexican hat dance, although they would prefer to dress as American Revolutionaries for the Independence Day celebration. At the party, Angela Ann watches jealously as Betsy easily enchants Dave, while Worthington snubs Claire and talks only to Pansy, whose food he adores. When Tom and Claire sneak off, Alfredo and Manuel do their best to interrupt the couple but fail to prevent Claire from kissing Tom in the stairway. Within days, Pansy learns that Tom has agreed to sell the ranch, and decides it is time for her to be part of the family and help solve the problem, even after Worthington reveals himself to be a multi-millionaire and offers to hire her away. After Alfredo and Manuel lie to Claire that Tom has a terrible temper, Pansy tells her that Worthington is a rich bachelor. Alfredo and Manuel then buy several expensive outfits and have them sent to Claire, who assumes that Tom has bought them for her, and leaves him with the huge bill. Although Tom tries to chastise her, her kisses confuse him and he pays the bill. Pansy once again takes over, now lying to Worthington that her recipes and techniques actually come from Claire, who will not openly cook for anyone until she has a husband. Worthington and Claire immediately begin an affair, and over the next few days, everyone in the house conspires to keep Tom away from the couple long enough for them to fall in love. One night, while Tom performs miserable magic tricks, Claire and Worthington try to sneak off to elope, but when Tom's trick explodes, they assume his terrible temper is at work and run and hide. Pansy, Alfredo and Manuel are forced to track down the lovers and facilitate their secret rendezvous. When the car finally drives away, they are surprised to see tin cans tied to its bumper, but Tom explains that he knew about the affair all along and wishes them only happiness. With his arms around his children, Tom announces that with his ranch, his family, and a wonderful cook, he lacks for nothing.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0047410/?ref_=sr_i_586,['Kay Lenard'],['Charles Lamont'],"['Marjorie Main', 'Chill Wills', 'Pedro Gonzalez Gonzalez', 'Alfonso Bedoya', 'Rudy Vallee', 'Ruth Hampton', 'Benay Venuta', 'Rachel Ames', 'Darryl Hickman', 'Lee Aaker']",,,,,"November 1, 1954",['United States'],"['Universal Studios - 100 Universal City Plaza, Universal City, California, USA (Studio)']",['Universal International Pictures (UI)'],,"['Comedy', 'Western']",['English']
