Moving Midway,2007,1h 35m,Not Rated,7.2,185,79.0,"At Christmas 2003, New York-based film critic Godfrey Cheshire is visiting his family in North Carolina when his cousin Charlie Silver tells him something startling. Charlie inherited Midway Plantation, the ancestral home of his and Cheshire's extended family, and has been its devoted caretaker. But now Charlie and his wife Dena have made a decision: They want to move Midway - the antebellum manor house and several outbuildings - to a new location to escape Raleigh's encroaching sprawl. Can you really transplant a plantation? Will the ""place"" be the same if it is uprooted from the soil in which it has stood since 1848? Charlie's plan provokes immediate controversy in Cheshire's tradition-minded family. For Cheshire, it brings back memories of the wild, strange and magical place Midway seemed when he was a child, and of the stories he heard there - stories of his mother's family, the Hintons, settling the area in the early 1700s, fighting in the Revolution, being invaded by Yankee troops in the Civil War, and surviving Reconstruction. Yet stories, Cheshire realizes, both convey and conceal. The reality of the Southern plantation was that it depended on the institution of slavery. In Cheshire's family, stories of slaves always depicted them as happy and devoted, which surely disguised a more painful, complex reality. In fact, Midway bred two sets of Hintons, one white, one black. For years, they have rarely encountered each other. But that begins to change as Cheshire sets out to chronicle Charlie's attempt to move Midway.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1051245/?ref_=sr_i_425,"['Bruce Chadwick', 'Elizabeth Cheshire']",['Godfrey Cheshire'],"['Bruce Chadwick', 'Elizabeth Cheshire']",,"$6,539","$40,864","$40,864","April 14, 2007",['United States'],"['North Carolina, USA']",,"Awards, 1 nomination total",['Documentary'],['English']

468. Holding Trevor,2007,1h 28m,R,5.4,1.5K,36.0,"Young, beautiful and intelligent, Trevor (screenwriter Brent Gorski) is in a stalemate. Entangled in an unhealthy relationship with Darrell, a self-destructive heroin addict, and trapped in a telemarketing job, Trevor finds scant comfort in Los Angeles' vapid party scene, where conversation rarely rises above inquiries like ""So, are you an actor?"" Worse still, he and his two best friends - roommate Andie and singer Jake - are being pulled apart by boredom and discontent. At the hospital for his boyfriend's latest overdose, Trevor finds a potential new beginning in Ephram, a medical intern with ambition, a warm demeanor and strikingly good looks. After they spend a romantic evening together, Trevor seems poised to make some changes. He begins by ending his relationship with Darrell and then strives to reconnect with Andie and Jake. But what should be a joyous event - a party celebrating a negative HIV test - explodes into rage and sorrow. Darrell shows up unannounced and makes a scene, Ephram suggests that Trevor isn't ready for a commitment, and Andie, reeling from a painful revelation, kicks Trevor while he's down. Though pulled in multiple directions, Trevor remains committed to bettering his life. But first he must realize that some people are too precious to abandon. Director Rosser Goodman (That's What I'm Talkin' 'Bout, Frameline29) finds rich emotional territory in Gorski's script, keeping it both focused and raw.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0960770/?ref_=sr_i_468,['Brent Gorski'],['Rosser Goodman'],"['Brent Gorski', 'Christopher Wyllie', 'Melissa Searing', 'Jay Brannan', 'Eli Kranski', 'Dawn Mondie', 'Joseph Roslan', 'Mathew Pasillas', 'Monica Todd', 'Isaiah Garnica']","$55,000 (estimated)","$7,829","$16,814","$16,814","June 16, 2007",['United States'],"['Hollywood, Los Angeles, California, USA']","['Circle Content', 'Stray Films']",,"['Dark Comedy', 'Drama', 'Romance']",['English']

510. Quantum Hoops,2007,1h 25m,Unrated,7.9,96,,"While most sports films celebrate the quest for a championship, ""Quantum Hoops"" follows a team that is searching for a single win. The documentary chronicles the final week of the 2006 Caltech basketball season. The team is currently in the midst of a 21 year losing streak - over 240 consecutive conference losses. Caltech is annually considered one of the top 5 academic institutions in the world yet its athletic department always takes a back seat to the achievements of its world renowned faculty, Nobel prize winners, and advancements in the world of science and technology. The film ""Real Genius (1985)"" was a not-so-subtle take on Caltech life. To the casual fan, the team might sound like a bad joke. There are more valedictorians on the team than players with high school basketball experience. In fact, the 5 seniors did not play high school basketball, yet all five are major contributors to the team. They are roundly mocked by opposing fans as ""nerds playing basketball"" (the few fans that decide its even worth it to show up). However, this season would mark an amazing turnaround from just two years ago when the team would lose by an average margin of over 60 points per game. Against remarkable odds and adversity, the players and coaches dedication, discipline, heart, and yes, SKILL would make for one of the most exciting seasons in school history. The final home game of the year would give the 5 seniors one last shot at that elusive win and an entry into the history books of college athletics.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1135944/?ref_=sr_i_510,['Rick Greenwald'],['Rick Greenwald'],"['Jonathan Bird', 'Brett Bush', 'Jordan Carlson', 'Scott Davies', 'Roy Dow', 'David Duchovny', 'Yang Hai', 'Travis Haussler', 'Jim Helgren', 'Day Ivy']",,"$4,216","$7,075","$7,075","November 2, 2007",['United States'],"['Los Angeles, California, USA']",['Green Forest Films'],,"['Documentary', 'Sport']",['English']

514. Operation Homecoming: Writing the Wartime Experience,2007,1h 21m,,7.2,450,,"A unique documentary about troops' experiences in Iraq and Afghanistan, based on writings by soldiers, Marines, and air men. Some writings were published in the New Yorker in summer 2006. A larger assortment was published as a book by Random House last September. The film drew upon the submissions by soldiers for the book. It's a remarkable portrait of troops at war - the complexities, doubts, and fears - written with honesty. The 81-minute version of the film (which will be in theatres) includes 11 pieces of writing, with different visual strategies, along with interviews with the writers, and with more established American writers who are also veterans. In the latter group are Tim O'Brien, Yusef Komunyakaa, Tobias Wolff, Joe Haldeman, James Salter, Anthony Swofford, Richard Currey, and Paul Fussell. The visual approaches range from poet Brian Turner reading directly to camera, to archival footage, to an animated ""graphic novel,"" to a still photo sequence shot by photographer Antonin Kratochvil. It's rooted in a program by the NEA that created a series of writing workshops at military bases. After those workshops, the writers submitted pieces for consideration in the book, edited by Andy Carroll. From those writings were selected 11 for inclusion in the film. There is also a 53-minute version of this film which will be airing on PBS as part of the series ""America at a Crossroads"" in April, 2007. Both of these are different from the other film 'Operation Homecoming"" from 2007, directed by Lawrence Bridges.
