Born the heir of the Burroughs' adding machine estate, he struggled throughout his life with addiction, control systems, and self.

Allen Ginsberg and Norman Mailer testified on behalf of the book. The courts eventually overturned their decision in 1966, ruling that the book had an important social value. It remains one of the most recognized literary works of the 20th century.

Whether exploring the pulsating energy of the city or contemplating quiet moments in the country, her artful camera compositions and the lyrical pacing of the film allow us to truly engage and process the foreign land on our own terms. Documenting Uganda while it deals with day-to-day realities and the aftermath of its civil wars, Takesue, well aware of her perspective as an outsider, strives for simple, unadorned honesty. Employing a largely observational style, Takesue allows the sight and sounds-and the people-of Uganda to speak for themselves. Usually the people she records simply ignore the camera, but when someone does engage-whether it's a group of school children clamoring for their moment in front of the lens or a young man asking the title question-the barriers between filmmaker, subject, and audience give way for breathtaking cinematic epiphanies.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1675311/?ref_=sr_i_518,[],['Kimi Takesue'],,,$937,"$1,492","$1,492","March 2, 2012","['United States', 'Uganda']",['Uganda'],"['Kimikat Productions', 'Lane Street Pictures']","Awards, 1 nomination total",['Documentary'],['English']
