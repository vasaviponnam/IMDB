He convinces his brother-in-law Karl Bach, the brother of his wife Elsa, that Hitler is leading Germany toward a second world war. Karl, in love with Anna, joins the movement, determined to restore German culture and save the people from the brutality of the Storm Troopers and the Gestapo. The group has an inside link through Albert Stalhelm, a Storm Trooper and one of Hitler's Elite Guards. Albert is sickened by the brutalities he sees and wants to resign and flee Germany, but Hans persuades him to remain until they can find a replacement. He agrees, but warns the group that he is forced to join in the Nazi orgies and liquor loosens his tongue. Elsa is about to have a baby and lives in terror that her husband's activities will be discovered, and she tries to persuade Hans to immigrate to the United States as she does not want their child to grow up as a Nazi. He decides to stay because his duty to his country and civilization can not be put aside, and Elsa refuses to leave without him. Warned by Lustig, a beer-garden bartender, that the Gestapo is watching them, Hans and Erlich, another active anti-Nazi, escape. Lustig is jailed and tortured but can not be made to talk. Hans is later captured and turned over to Albert and two other SS men to be tortured, and Albert does not dare move to save his friend.

The SS men listen to him reveal the names of the group members, then shoot him. Hans, Lustig, Schultz, Karl and Father Pommer are thrown into a concentration camp, where the commandant is Hans' friend from World War I, Colonel Hess, who orders that Hans be treated decently, but the others do not fare well, as they are beaten, humiliated and forced to praise Hitler. Erlich, who has escaped the dragnet, tells Elsa and Anna that Lippert, a crooked Nazi lawyer, can secure Hans' release for a thousand marks. Hans and the others are sold out as slave labor by the camp guards who only see the oppressed prisoners as a means of personal profit. Hans bitterly tells Hess that Hitler is strangling Germany and that he will never submit to the rule of a lunatic. Hess orders him beaten and refuses to release him when Lippert's order comes through. Through the help of a guard, Braun, Hans escapes and he and Elsa reach the border, but Hans decides he can not leave Germany while the Nazis rule and he returns to help Erlich rebuild the anti-Nazi organization.

Jay's hope for that relaxing weekend is quickly thrown out the window with the goings-on of Ann's family. Her mother, septuagenarian Mrs. Whitman, is overly inquisitive and slyly meddling. Lewis' sister, Connie Nevins, is arriving from Reno following her third divorce, no single man, like Jay, safe in her search for husband number four.

Ellen and her Boston-residing boyfriend Douglas Hall, who the family has yet to meet, have had one problem after another in their relationship. However this weekend, they have finally come to a mutual understanding that they love each other, bad timing in that Doug is leaving at the end of the weekend for two years to work in Belgium to earn money to start his life.

Instead of spending the weekend in Hartford at a girlfriend's as was her plan, Ellen suggests she and Doug spend the weekend together alone before he goes away, something she doesn't want to tell anyone in they probably viewing it with suspicion. When Ann gets wind of what Ellen is planning on doing, she has to decide whether to stop her or to trust her in that they will not do anything inappropriate, she knowing Lewis never approving of Ellen's plan. A factor in the situation is the secret or not so secret fact that Ann and Jay really used to be in Ellen and Doug's position when they were younger - Jay the nameless poet in Ann's life, a poet of who the family is aware - they losing touch possibly the only reason why they aren't married to each other today, with Ann's invitation to Jay for this weekend truly only for the aforementioned reasons and nothing more.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0032149/?ref_=sr_i_292

Later that night at a ""clip-joint,"" a nightclub in which hostesses persuade male customers to buy expensive drinks, hostess June White unhappily plies her trade while fending off the advances of the club's owner, Gus Brawley. June, who only works in the club to support her parents back home, reads Barney's column and dreams of spending an old-fashioned Christmas with him.
