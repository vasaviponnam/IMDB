With the aid of Gustav Schultz, Father Pommer, Anna Wahl and others, he is gleaning accurate information from foreign radio broadcasts and distributing it through Germany with an underground-press operation. He convinces his brother-in-law Karl Bach, the brother of his wife Elsa, that Hitler is leading Germany toward a second world war. Karl, in love with Anna, joins the movement, determined to restore German culture and save the people from the brutality of the Storm Troopers and the Gestapo. The group has an inside link through Albert Stalhelm, a Storm Trooper and one of Hitler's Elite Guards. Albert is sickened by the brutalities he sees and wants to resign and flee Germany, but Hans persuades him to remain until they can find a replacement. He agrees, but warns the group that he is forced to join in the Nazi orgies and liquor loosens his tongue. Elsa is about to have a baby and lives in terror that her husband's activities will be discovered, and she tries to persuade Hans to immigrate to the United States as she does not want their child to grow up as a Nazi. He decides to stay because his duty to his country and civilization can not be put aside, and Elsa refuses to leave without him. Warned by Lustig, a beer-garden bartender, that the Gestapo is watching them, Hans and Erlich, another active anti-Nazi, escape. Lustig is jailed and tortured but can not be made to talk. Hans is later captured and turned over to Albert and two other SS men to be tortured, and Albert does not dare move to save his friend. Sickened by the brutality, Albert tries to go home, but is forced to join a party, where he gets drunk and says he has to go warn his friends. The SS men listen to him reveal the names of the group members, then shoot him. Hans, Lustig, Schultz, Karl and Father Pommer are thrown into a concentration camp, where the commandant is Hans' friend from World War I, Colonel Hess, who orders that Hans be treated decently, but the others do not fare well, as they are beaten, humiliated and forced to praise Hitler. Erlich, who has escaped the dragnet, tells Elsa and Anna that Lippert, a crooked Nazi lawyer, can secure Hans' release for a thousand marks. Hans and the others are sold out as slave labor by the camp guards who only see the oppressed prisoners as a means of personal profit. Hans bitterly tells Hess that Hitler is strangling Germany and that he will never submit to the rule of a lunatic. Hess orders him beaten and refuses to release him when Lippert's order comes through. Through the help of a guard, Braun, Hans escapes and he and Elsa reach the border, but Hans decides he can not leave Germany while the Nazis rule and he returns to help Erlich rebuild the anti-Nazi organization.

Ann's husband, Lewis Murray, is much more conservative than his liberal wife but is generally broad minded. Jay's hope for that relaxing weekend is quickly thrown out the window with the goings-on of Ann's family. Her mother, septuagenarian Mrs. Whitman, is overly inquisitive and slyly meddling. Lewis' sister, Connie Nevins, is arriving from Reno following her third divorce, no single man, like Jay, safe in her search for husband number four. But most of the commotion this weekend surrounds Lewis and Ann's twenty year old daughter, recent college graduate and yet to be employed Ellen Murray. Ellen and her Boston-residing boyfriend Douglas Hall, who the family has yet to meet, have had one problem after another in their relationship. However this weekend, they have finally come to a mutual understanding that they love each other, bad timing in that Doug is leaving at the end of the weekend for two years to work in Belgium to earn money to start his life. As such, it isn't the right time for them to get married without that financial foundation with both Doug and Ellen having no money of their own. Instead of spending the weekend in Hartford at a girlfriend's as was her plan, Ellen suggests she and Doug spend the weekend together alone before he goes away, something she doesn't want to tell anyone in they probably viewing it with suspicion. When Ann gets wind of what Ellen is planning on doing, she has to decide whether to stop her or to trust her in that they will not do anything inappropriate, she knowing Lewis never approving of Ellen's plan. A factor in the situation is the secret or not so secret fact that Ann and Jay really used to be in Ellen and Doug's position when they were younger - Jay the nameless poet in Ann's life, a poet of who the family is aware - they losing touch possibly the only reason why they aren't married to each other today, with Ann's invitation to Jay for this weekend truly only for the aforementioned reasons and nothing more.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0032149/?ref_=sr_i_292,"['Casey Robinson', 'Mark Reed']",['William Keighley'],"['Priscilla Lane', 'Jeffrey Lynn', 'Roland Young', 'Fay Bainter', 'May Robson', 'Genevieve Tobin', 'Ian Hunter', 'Robert Homans', 'Edward Gargan', 'Spencer Charters']",,,,,"February 25, 1939",['United States'],"['Warner Brothers Burbank Studios - 4000 Warner Boulevard, Burbank, California, USA']","['First National Pictures', 'Warner Bros.']","Awards, 4 wins total","['Comedy', 'Mystery', 'Romance']",['English']

She Married a Cop,1939,1h 6m,Approved,5.1,88,,"At the New York branch of Mammoth Studios, motion picture animator Linda Fay and her boss, Bob Adams, search for a singing voice for their star cartoon, ""Paddy the Pig."" Linda holds auditions in her apartment, but a neighbor, disturbed by the noise, calls the police. Officers Jimmy Duffy and Joe Nash answer the call and sell Linda tickets to the policeman's ball after cautioning her to keep the noise down. As Jimmy ushers one of the singers out, he instructs him on how to sing. Linda hears his beautiful voice and eagerly awaits the ball. Linda, Bob, their pianist Sidney and secretary, Mabel Dunne, attend the ball and agree after Jimmy sings that he has the voice they need. The others then convince Linda to hire Jimmy without telling him that he is supplying the voice of a pig, but instead, letting him think that he will be a real actor. Two weeks pass as Jimmy records Paddy's songs, and he and Linda rapidly fall in love. Bob is jealous because he also loves Linda, but he realizes that there is little he can do and therefore signs Jimmy to a contract. Thrilled with the contract, Jimmy informs his family that he is quitting the police force. His parents are dismayed by his proclamation and also by his interest in Linda, whom they are afraid is too upper class for Jimmy, but their son's enthusiasm wins them over. Jimmy and Linda marry on the day of the cartoon's sneak preview, and Linda does not get a chance to tell Jimmy the truth before he sees it. All of Jimmy's family and police friends are there, and their laughter upon hearing his voice coming from the mouth of a pig wounds Jimmy to the core. That night, Joe finds Jimmy after he has gotten drunk and takes him to Linda's apartment. The next day, Jimmy bitterly accuses Linda of marrying him so that he would not break his contract, and soon after, he returns to the force. Determined to win back Jimmy, Linda moves in with his family. Jimmy counters by volunteering to work the night shift, thereby turning their schedules upside down. Bob convinces Linda to work at the studio while Jimmy is patrolling his beat, and as a week goes by, the Duffy family becomes suspicious as Linda is brought home by Bob early each morning. Meanwhile, Jimmy's cartoon is a hit and demand for a sequel grows. One afternoon, Jimmy, Linda and the family attend the policeman's picnic, and Jimmy is pleasantly surprised by the acclaim of young Paddy fans when they discover who Jimmy is. Jimmy promises Linda that they will make a fresh start, but late that night when Bob is rushing Linda home, Jimmy stops Bob's speeding car and sees his wife. Jimmy jumps to conclusions and punches Bob, after which Linda calls off their reconciliation. The next day, Jimmy's sister Trudy attempts to play peacemaker, and she sees a cartoon baby Linda has drawn with the caption ""James Duffy, Jr. as I imagine him."" Trudy is interviewed by reporters after she leaves Linda's apartment, and she leaks the news that Linda is pregnant. Jimmy sees the story in the newspaper and rushes to the studio, where Linda is previewing a cartoon about Paddy and his children. Jimmy is delighted that Paddy is a father, and he embraces Linda as she confirms that he is to be one too.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0031921/?ref_=sr_i_318,"['Robert Bennett', 'Olive Cooper', 'Samuel Fuller']","['Sidney Salkow', 'Cal Dalton', 'Ben Hardaway']","['Phil Regan', 'Jean Parker', 'Jerome Cowan', 'Dorothea Kent', 'Benny Baker', 'Barnett Parker', 'Horace McMahon', ""Oscar O'Shea"", 'Mary Gordon', 'Muriel Campbell']",,,,,"July 12, 1939",['United States'],"['Republic Studios, Hollywood, Los Angeles, California, USA (Studio)']",['Republic Pictures (I)'],"Nominated for 1 Oscar, 1 nomination total","['Comedy', 'Musical']",['English']

As Barney is lamenting not being able to get his first column in on time, his photographer, Snapper Doolan, assures Barney that he did write a column the night before while he was drunk. Barney's story details how he is the loneliest man in New York and is searching for the loneliest girl, with whom he would like to share an idyllic Christmas on an upstate farm. Barney is surprised by the response of his editor, J. B. Douglas, who thinks that the column is a winner and offers to let him use his own farm, complete with caretakers Mary and Ben Perkins, who will pose as Barney's aunt and uncle. Later that night at a ""clip-joint,"" a nightclub in which hostesses persuade male customers to buy expensive drinks, hostess June White unhappily plies her trade while fending off the advances of the club's owner, Gus Brawley. June, who only works in the club to support her parents back home, reads Barney's column and dreams of spending an old-fashioned Christmas with him. June's roommate and co-worker Eunice warns June not to get any ideas about splitting with Brawley, as the last girl who did was killed. Brawley sends June back out on the floor, where she picks her next mark, the young and well-to-do Paul Randall. She steals Paul's wallet, and when he later complains, June witnesses Paul confront Brawley in Brawley's office. The club owner kills the youth and orders his henchman, Whitey Walker, to dispose of the body. The next morning, Whitey confides to June that he was driving all night, and June, anxious to get away, contacts Douglas about Barney's column. After Douglas chooses June, Barney meets her at the train station on the day before Christmas and they go to the farm. There they are greeted by the kindly Perkinses, and June blossoms under their care and Barney's solicitude. The next day, the couples open their presents, and after Barney goes to town to replace an ornament he has broken, June bakes a pie for him. While Barney is gone, however, Brawley arrives and orders June to return with him. Convinced that June has given the details of his organization to Barney, he tries to kill her. When frantic Barney finds her in the hospital soon after, he is disillusioned to find out that she is not the wholesome girl he believed she was. She agrees to testify against Brawley, but during the trial, changes her testimony and states that she knows nothing about Paul's murder. Barney is furious, although later she reveals that she perjured herself to get in good with Brawley so that she could discover where Whitey hid Paul's body. Following a clue provided by June, Barney and Snapper find the house in New Jersey where Whitey took the corpse and alert the police. Before the police arrive though, Brawley brings June to the house to kill her. Two elderly neighbors, Flora and Dora, help rescue June, and the police arrest Brawley. Later, with the past behind them and a bright future they can look forward to, June and Barney take the train to the farm to celebrate the new year.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0031488/?ref_=sr_i_592,"['Ben Ames Williams', 'Jerome Cady', 'Herbert Clyde Lewis']",['Ricardo Cortez'],"['Michael Whalen', 'Jean Rogers', 'Chick Chandler', 'Douglas Fowley', ""John 'Dusty' King"", 'Jane Darwell', 'June Gale', 'Spencer Charters', 'Theodore von Eltz', 'Cliff Clark']",,,,,"March 10, 1939",['United States'],"['20th Century Fox Studios - 10201 Pico Blvd., Century City, Los Angeles, California, USA (Studio)']",['Twentieth Century Fox'],,['Drama'],['English']
