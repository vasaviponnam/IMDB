This motto of Narsi Mehta was remembered in morning prayers of Mahatma Gandhi and his followers. After 500 years, the spirit of Narsi Mehta was re-born in Mahatma Gandhi. . Narsi was a poor mute boy, born in Brahmin family of Junagadh (Saurashtra) in 15th Century. From very childhood he had great leaning towards Sadhus and was fond of attending Kirtans. Once he came in contact of a saint, and by the blessing of the saint Narsi obtained the power of speech- and thus from the childhood, he become great devotee of God. . Narsis grand mother and elder brother were not in favour of his assoiciation with Sadhus and his learning towards Bhakti, therefore they arranged his marriage with Manik Mehti, and after some years Narsi became the father of son and a daughter. But during all these years Narsis inclination towards Bhakti was unchanged. His Bhabi (brothers wife) became envious because of his fruitless activities, and started taunting and harrassing him, his wife, son and daughter. Sarangdhar( the brother of Narsis Bhabi) employed malacious tractis and ultimately succeeded in separating Narsi and his family from his brother. . Narsi Mehta who was a great devotee, and for whose honour God performed miracles on the occasions of his grand mothers death ceremony ( Sharadh- Tehri) and Mamera (Bhat) of his grand daughtes marriage; was a believer in equality of rights for every human being. He could not see merciless and inhuman treatment of priests and Brahmins towards Untouchables. He opposed vehemantly the cast order and rude behaviour of high placed people of the society. Sarandhar all the while was instigating the citizens and was gathering hooligans against him. Thus Narsi became the torch-bearer of social revolution. . Mandlik-the king of Junagadh-called Narsi in his court and asked him to sing Kedar Raag. Narsi could not do so, as he had mortgaged the same with some one. Mandlik ordered his imprisonment and a miracle took place. Sarangdhar represented to the King that Narsi has obtained black powers and it is he who has done this......However, God Almighty came to the rescue of his great devotee, and Narsi was able to establish himself as the True Devoteee of God.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0214980/?ref_=sr_i_546
