His wife Mary has accompanied him on the pretense to set up their home, with their adolescent son Tony arriving on a flight two weeks later. Dick requested the transfer to escape the source of marital strife between him and Mary, namely another woman, that being the real reason for their need for time alone without Tony. Mary has decided to take Tony back to the US with her instead. Their marital problems take a back seat upon learning that Tony's flight, facing mechanical problems, is lost somewhere en route and forced to land somewhere in the middle of the ocean. They are relieved to learn that while he was separated from the main group of passengers, Tony, alive, was picked up by a small family-operated Japanese fishing boat based 500km away from Tokyo. Taken care of by the Japanese family, the Tanakas, Tony befriends their similarly aged son, Hiko, the only one among the three in the family who speaks any English. But when Hiko overhears his father saying that he will be contacting the police about Tony, he and Tony run away in equating police with having done something bad, meaning Tony going to jail. So while Dick and Mary make their way to the fishing village, the two boys try to make their way to Tokyo to reunite Tony with his parents. However, what two adolescent boys believe is making their way to Tokyo 500km away may not always be reality as they try to survive with what little they brought with them.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0050363/?ref_=sr_i_273,['Winston Miller'],['Arthur Lubin'],"['Teresa Wright', 'Cameron Mitchell', 'Jon Provost', 'Roger Nakagawa', 'Philip Ober', 'Kuniko Miyake', 'Susumu Fujita', 'Katsuhiko Haida', 'Tatsuo Saitô', 'Leticia Bahia']",,,,,November 1957,['United States'],"['Kiyomizu Temple, Kyoto, Japan (where the young girl shares her bento box lunch with the boys)']",['Arthur Lubin Productions'],,"['Road Trip', 'Adventure', 'Family']","['English', 'Japanese']"

This motto of Narsi Mehta was remembered in morning prayers of Mahatma Gandhi and his followers. After 500 years, the spirit of Narsi Mehta was re-born in Mahatma Gandhi. . Narsi was a poor mute boy, born in Brahmin family of Junagadh (Saurashtra) in 15th Century. From very childhood he had great leaning towards Sadhus and was fond of attending Kirtans. Once he came in contact of a saint, and by the blessing of the saint Narsi obtained the power of speech- and thus from the childhood, he become great devotee of God. . Narsis grand mother and elder brother were not in favour of his assoiciation with Sadhus and his learning towards Bhakti, therefore they arranged his marriage with Manik Mehti, and after some years Narsi became the father of son and a daughter. But during all these years Narsis inclination towards Bhakti was unchanged. His Bhabi (brothers wife) became envious because of his fruitless activities, and started taunting and harrassing him, his wife, son and daughter. Sarangdhar( the brother of Narsis Bhabi) employed malacious tractis and ultimately succeeded in separating Narsi and his family from his brother. . Narsi Mehta who was a great devotee, and for whose honour God performed miracles on the occasions of his grand mothers death ceremony ( Sharadh- Tehri) and Mamera (Bhat) of his grand daughtes marriage; was a believer in equality of rights for every human being. He could not see merciless and inhuman treatment of priests and Brahmins towards Untouchables. He opposed vehemantly the cast order and rude behaviour of high placed people of the society. Sarandhar all the while was instigating the citizens and was gathering hooligans against him. Thus Narsi became the torch-bearer of social revolution. . Mandlik-the king of Junagadh-called Narsi in his court and asked him to sing Kedar Raag. Narsi could not do so, as he had mortgaged the same with some one. Mandlik ordered his imprisonment and a miracle took place. Sarangdhar represented to the King that Narsi has obtained black powers and it is he who has done this......However, God Almighty came to the rescue of his great devotee, and Narsi was able to establish himself as the True Devoteee of God.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0214980/?ref_=sr_i_546,"['Shahu Modak', 'Radhakrishan', 'Pratima Devi']",['Devendra Goel'],"['Shahu Modak', 'Radhakrishan', 'Pratima Devi', 'Nirupa Roy', 'Lalita Pawar', 'Madan Puri']",,,,,,['India'],,['Goel Cine Corporation'],,['Biography'],['Hindi']
