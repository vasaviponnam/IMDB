476. The WAC from Walla Walla,1952,1h 23m,Approved,6.1,36,,"Although three generations of Jud Canovas have distinguished themselves in service to their country, from Bull Run to World War I, the line of military Canovas seems to have ended when a daughter, Judy, is born instead of a fourth Jud. On the same night, lightning in the town square destroys the statue of Jud Canova I, and over the years, Judy's recurring mishaps delay Gramps Canova's efforts to restore it, until finally his nemesis, Col. Mayfield, convinces the town council to put a Mayfield hero on the empty pedestal. Despite the Mayfield-Canova feud, the grown-up Judy develops a crush on young Lt. Tom Mayfield, and when Tom says he needs to ask her about a hayride, she joyously assumes he wants to ask her for a date. Needing a dress for the occasion, Judy visits the town's only dress shop which is run by the sophisticated Doris Vail, who is Judy's rival for Tom's affection. When the unfashionable Judy chooses an outfit that is hanging in the shop's unfinished window display, Doris points out that it is a special outfit, only available from a woman down the street. After introducing herself to the woman, a WAC recruiting sergeant, Judy learns that the dress she admires is really a WAC uniform. Meanwhile, two men identifying themselves as Prentice and Redington of International Amalgamated arrive in town and want to hire Tom for a project. As a military officer on active duty, he rejects their offer, leaving them to report their failure to their boss, who then decides to handle the matter himself. As Judy is leaving the recruiting sergeant, Tom sees her and states how proud he is that she has joined up, and then asks if he can borrow her family's wagon to use for the hayride. Broken-hearted that she was not asked for a date, Judy decides to attend the hayride on her own, and that evening, she and Doris end up sitting on the wagon with Tom, who is oblivious to their rivalry. When Doris teases Judy about mistaking a WAC uniform for a chic dress, the embarrassed Judy explains that she was set straight by the recruiting sergeant, but enlisted after Tom expressed pride in her. In the morning, when Judy reports at the train station with the other new recruits, Doris is among them, having enlisted with the hopes of also winning Tom's approval. For the naive Judy, basic training is difficult, as Doris' incessant tricks often get her into trouble. During compass training, Doris alters the directions on Judy's instruction sheet, causing her to wander into an area where live ammunition is being used. Mistaken for one of the men, she is dragged through their maneuvers, and after shaking them off, is almost arrested for trespassing in a top secret area. Fortunately, Tom recognizes her, and tells her about the guided missile homing device they are testing. Later, when the women complete their training, both Judy and Doris ask to be assigned to Ordnance to be near Tom. Shortly after reporting for duty, they are confronted by a general who wants data about the missiles. However, when he says his name is Mayfield and describes the Canovas as ""fine people,"" Judy is certain that he is a phony. Working with the bogus general are Prentice and Redington, and the three spies escape with the homing device for the secret missile, a black box. By chasing them in an Army jeep, Judy catches up and rides off with the black box, but meanwhile, the rocket has been launched as part of a demonstration for top Army officials, and the box is its target. Judy unwittingly toggles the switch on the box, causing the rocket to circle above, but when the spies get too close to her, toggles it back, letting the low-flying rocket scatter them. The chase continues on foot after Judy's jeep gets stuck. Using the box as a blunt object, she knocks out one of the men, and even disables the second spy. As she is wrestling with the third, Doris and Tom, both of whom are impressed, arrive with help. Later, for her service in apprehending the spies, Judy is awarded a medal during a hometown ceremony in which the statues of Jud Canova I and Major Mayfield are unveiled together in the town square. After the ceremony, Judy joins a parade of her fellow WACs, as they all march away.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0045303/?ref_=sr_i_476

When Manuela learns of her father's arrangement, she and Pedro, with the help of her sister Estelita, try to elope. While hurriedly packing Manuela's belongings, however, Estelita is accidentally knocked unconscious by a flying suitcase. Finding Estelita in distress, Jerry Taylor, an American professor at Whitmore College, takes her in his arms and carries her to safety. Gonzales, angered by the sight of what he thinks is his future daughter-in-law in another man's arms, calls the police. Estelita, who has fallen in love with Jerry, is disappointed when the professor tells her that he is returning to America soon, and tries to prevent him from leaving by telling the police that he kidnapped her. Meanwhile, newspapers report Manuela's engagement to Estaban, but she has already secretly married Pedro. Soon after Jerry is released from jail, he goes to the Rodriguezes' and gives Estelita a spanking. Later, confusion ensues when Estelita, impersonating Manuela, tells Jerry that he spanked her identical sister. Having never met the real Manuela, Jerry believes the lie and apologizes to ""Manuela."" Continuing her deception, Estelita persuades her father to send Manuela to California to complete her education, and then secures her own passage abroad by convincing her father that Manuela will need her help there. As part of Estelita's plan, Pedro, disguised as a police officer, arrests Estaban for a traffic violation, thus giving Pedro and Manuela the opportunity to elope.

Bal Tabarin,1952,1h 24m,Approved,6.7,14,,"Fearing that she is being followed, Judy Allen, a singer from Los Angeles, turns up unexpectedly at the Parisian apartment of her friend, Stella Simmons, and tells this story: Because her singing career in Los Angeles has not been going well, Judy accepts a position as personal secretary for a wealthy man, Eddie Mendies. One evening as she and Mendies are working, a man shoots Mendies through the window. As she drives Mendies to the hospital, he behaves strangely, putting a small key in a wad of chewing gum. Then, giving her a large amount of money held with a money clip, Mendies tells her to lay low for her own safety. From the newspapers, she later learns that Mendies, who dies in the hospital, was a racketeer and jewel fence. The police are looking for the witness to the murder and for missing jewels. Afraid and not thinking clearly, Judy fears that the police suspect her of the killing and that the murderer, whom she cannot identify, is out to get her, so she flees the country. Safe in Stella's apartment, Judy sees that she was foolish not to go to the police, but she knew nothing and wants to remain hidden. Stella invites Judy to stay with her and later introduces her to Don Barlow, an American songwriter hoping for his big break. Don invites Judy and Stella to accompany him to a performance at the famous nightclub, Bal Tabarin . However, during the performance, Judy is frightened by a mysterious man who approaches her, and has Don take her home early. The man, Joe Goheen, later introduces himself to the French police inspector, Manet, as a private investigator looking for Judy. Goheen says he expects that Judy will come to Paris, because he found a postcard sent from Paris in her Los Angeles apartment. However, as Judy has not yet registered with the police, Manet is unable to help. As time goes by, Don shows Judy around Paris and they find themselves mutually attracted. Don tells her that he has not achieved success during his two years in Paris, so must shortly return to his family, who oppose his musical pursuits, in the United States to help run their business. Later, Judy confides to Stella that Don proposed, but she fears his straight-laced family will disapprove of her. Meanwhile, Manet has learned from United States police that Judy is involved with a murder. Skeptical of Goheen's story, Manet has his apartment secretly searched and learns that Goheen has a suspiciously large expense account for a private investigator. At a cafe, Goheen clandestinely meets with Little Augie, his partner in the Mendies murder. Although Goheen did the actual killing, Augie fears that Judy, if interviewed by the police, will identify him, as she knows that he worked for Mendies. Both mobsters are anxious to find her before the police and hope that she can lead them to the key to Mendies' safe, where they believe jewels are hidden. Later, at a restaurant where Stella, Don and Judy are dining, musicians who know Don invite him to play one of his songs and Judy sings along. Hearing them, Jean Dufar, the owner of the Bal Tabarin , invites them to his office the next day and offers them jobs performing Don's music. Meanwhile, at the cafe Goheen frequents, Manet confronts Goheen with what he has learned about the murder and the missing jewels. Goheen now claims he is an insurance inspector, and as they talk, Judy and Stella show up in front of the cafe. Goheen overhears them mention the name of their apartment building, but Manet does not see them. Later, Goheen and Augie break into Stella's apartment and after finding Mendies' money clip among Judy's things, conclude that Judy also has the key to his safe. On the day that Don and Judy are to open at the Bal Tabarin , Manet learns where Judy is staying through the work permit office.
