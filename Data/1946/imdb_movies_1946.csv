At the Tranquility station, the woman, whose name is Constance Stevenson, her father and their lawyer, Wilson, detrain and introduce themselves as the Smiths, claiming that they are in town to fish in the lake. Station master Roy Acuff, who does not see his brother Danny sneak into town, is also enthralled by Constance. Immediately afterward, Stevenson reminds Wilson not to reveal that he is really the president of the railroad, and is actually in town to buy up the land around the lake in order to lay tracks through it, a plan which will desiccate area farms. At home, Roy brings Mom Acuff a birthday cake and she wishes that Danny were there, after his three years in jail for robbery. Just then, Danny slips into his seat and a warm family reunion ensues until Danny realizes that Roy works for the very railroad that Danny blames for framing him. Danny storms out and stays with moon-shining brothers Chad and Asa Morgan, unaware that they actually performed the robbery for which he was framed. The next day, Roy visits Danny, who saves him during a fight with Chad, but is still cold toward his brother until Roy announces that he has quit the railroad and wants to start a farm with Danny. Later on the farm, Roy is stunned by the sight of Constance fishing on a rock in the lake. When she falls into the water and hits her head, he rescues her just as Danny comes by, so he hands her to Danny and runs for the doctor. By the time he returns, everyone assumes Danny is the hero, and though Roy is upset at first he allows the misunderstanding to continue when Danny tells him that he and Constance are in love. The next night at a square dance, Stevenson offers to buy everyone's share of the lake land, supposedly for ""the timber."" After the party, Stevenson catches Constance with Danny and reprimands her for dating beneath her class, and within hours the Stevensons are gone. A few days later, a heartbroken Danny receives a letter from Constance in which she states that she is returning to tell him something, just as Rainbow, their family friend and local train inspector, announces that the Stevensons are really railroaders after the farmers' land. Against Roy's advice, an angry Danny agrees to see Constance, but when he does, he pretends to defend her against Chad, causing her to shoot at Chad, who then fakes his death. Danny then blackmails Stevenson for the property rights in exchange for his silence about ""the murder,"" not realizing that Constance has mentally collapsed from guilt. Stevenson gives back the land rights but Roy forces Danny to tell the truth, at which point they realize how sick Constance is. They run to get Chad to show him to Constance, and when they arrive at his place, he is fighting with Asa. When Asa pulls out his gun, Danny recognizes it as the weapon from the robbery for which he was jailed, and realizes who his true enemy is. After a chase into the hills, Asa shoots and kills Chad, and everyone agrees to tell Constance he has been hit by a train. This shocks her out of her depression, and though Roy returns the land grants to Stevenson, the thankful father tears them up.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0038775/?ref_=sr_i_430

Ty reminds Pam, who once aspired to a career as a professional singer, that she, too, is caught in the ""jingle jungle,"" which keeps her employed. Ty also tries to stem Pam's jealousy as he pays an increasing amount of attention to Lynn Stafford, an attractive advertising executive who is interested in more than Ty's songs. Pam and Ty's flirtatious, sparring relationship has never blossomed into a full-blown romance, but Pam keeps hoping that someday Ty will stop taking her for granted. Pam's roommate, Sherry Lane, pays little attention to Pam's complaints, as she feels that Ty is not good enough for Pam. Sherry, who is a costume designer for the prestigious Earl Carroll's Sketchbook musical revue on Broadway, also refuses to help when Pam asks her to give Carroll some of Ty's songs. Sherry explains that Carroll is on a South American tour and suggests that Pam try for herself. Pam then goes to the theater, where harried stage manager Rick Castle misunderstands her intentions when she sings one of Ty's songs, and instead of buying the song, offers Pam a job as a featured singer. Sherry quickly accepts the offer for Pam, but before Pam can tell Ty the good news, she is angered when she sees him kissing Lynn. As Pam is leaving Ty's apartment, she is hit by a car, and although she is not seriously hurt, the doctor's warning about potential amnesia gives her an idea. Telling Sherry that she wants to teach Ty a lesson, Pam pretends to have amnesia and tells the worried Ty that she does not know who he is. Castle, who is developing feelings for Pam himself, overhears the two women discussing their scheme but plays along by sending Pam to mind-reader Milo Edwards, who pretends to be a psychiatrist. Time passes as Pam devotes herself to rehearsals, and Ty, who now realizes how much Pam means to him, tries to help her regain her memory. Pam finally succumbs to Ty's romantic attentions, but more complications ensue when one of his songs, pushed by Pam, is incorporated in the ""Vanities"" by Castle, even though Ty has used the melody for a jingle for radio sponsor John Clark. Castle, who believes that Pam wrote the tune, tells Ty about the amnesia ruse and makes him think that Pam did it to escape from him. Disillusioned, Ty breaks with Pam, and on opening night, the heartbroken Pam confesses to Castle that Ty is the real author of the song. Realizing that Pam is still in love with Ty, Castle assures her that all will be well, then hides from Clark's lawyer, John Hawks, who attempts to serve him with a summons to prevent the revue from using Ty's song in the finale. The show starts as planned and is a huge success, and as the finale begins, Sherry brings Ty backstage.

It is obvious that he is being forced to put Dolly back in the show. And there is also Blossom Terraine who wants the star role and is using her suitor Chick Malloy, the comedian of the show to back her. Dolly arrives in a snit and immediately starts a quarrel with Crystal. And Dolly's day gets worse when Lola Cassell shows up and accuses Dolly of having driven to suicide the man they both loved. Dolly's bad day ends when Annie, the wardrobe woman who idolizes Crystal, finds her strangled body in a dressing room trunk. The first person Inspector Crowley suspects is Chick, for he had been overheard in an incriminating conversation with Blossom. Then he turns to Crystal, as the result of a threat she had made, plus he learns that a story Steve is writing revolves around the finding of a strangled body in a trunk. To complete the Inspector's own bad day, albeit somewhat better than Dolly's, he finds out that Lola had visited Dolly in her dressing room, and that Chick is blackmailing Nolan into putting Blossom in the starring role and has evidence that Nolan had also been in Dolly's dressing room in between the other traffic. THEN, Annie, fearing that Crystal will be arrested, confesses to the murder. The police do not believe her, and give orders that nobody is to leave the theatre until the murderer is found which, based on the number of suspects, gives no indication of happening anytime soon. The list is narrowed when Lola is found dead in a phone booth, with a knife thrust in her back. And while he is questioning the rest of the group in Nolan's office, the lights go out, and Blossom exits stage left by being murdered. Chick accuses Nolan, who admits he was also in Dolly's dressing room - who wasn't - only because she was blackmailing him but she was alive when he left. A shot rings out in Crystal's dressing room, where they find Annie in a faint, but unharmed by the bullet. An inspection of the room shows that Annie fired the bullet at herself, and Steve's adroit questioning tricks Annie into confessing that she was the killer, the crimes being committed as the result of a homicidal mania induced by Annie's intense love for Crystal, who she mistakenly believes to be her daughter.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0038864/?ref_=sr_i_545
