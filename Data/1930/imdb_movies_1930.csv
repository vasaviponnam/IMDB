That same night, Aubrey sees a letter Joe has just received from Morgan and Jennings, two patent attorneys who are interested in an automobile process Joe has invented.

Meanwhile, after Ma signs papers to receive Pa's life insurance, she and Clara talk about Aubrey, and Clara admits that she envies her sister because Aubrey is such a loving husband, while Frank, though an excellent provider, is too busy to pay much attention to her. After court, Aubrey goes to see Morgan and Jennings.

John meets Freil, another Mountie, who gives him an encouraging talk about self-respect and unselfishness and promises never to dredge up the former's past record. Alice, Freil's daughter, returns home by canoe after visiting her ailing former nurse. When her canoe heads for the rapids, Smith rescues her, and Alice then promises to save a dance for him at a party that night at the lodge.

Smith returns from his mission unscathed and tells Alice that he did not want to take the mission alone, contradicting Turner's earlier claim that Smith requested the mission in order to prove his bravery. Smith then goes to the police barracks and encounters Turner, who informs Smith that he has sent for his official war record but will remain silent about its contents if Smith resigns.

Alice hears of John's resignation and vows to stand by him despite his past, while Doyle assures her that anyone would have transgressed in his situation.

Claire wants to get married. But, Stoddard, whom she cares for very much, has several proposals directed at her, none of which sound remotely like a marriage proposal; Claire tells him, in her straight-forward, no-nonsense manner that she wants to get married because, in her words: ""I'm running away from the doubts and uncertainty and problems of a woman who isn't married."" Stoddard thinks that nuptial bonds is a stupid old-fashioned tradition and fatal to romance. She says any man who says that is lying, and when she departs his suite at the crack of dawn, she seems convinced Stoddard indeed believes what he said he believed. But Claire has another option awaiting her...a Texan from home, and she promptly accepts his marriage proposal. But the house detective comes along after the ceremony and tells Tex his version of what he thinks goes on when a woman stays in a man's suite until the crack of dawn, and that doesn't jibe with his definition of a moral woman, and he ups and leaves her. Stoddard comes along and he thinks Tex has made a mockery of the marriage vows he took a short while ago, and he tells Claire that he will marry her, as soon as she can get an annulment from that day's ceremony, and they will make a go of it because they are 'different.'
