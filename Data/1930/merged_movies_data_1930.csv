Despite the strenuous objections of her parents and sister Clara, Amy Fisher sees another side of Aubrey and accepts his proposal of marriage. Ma Fisher predicts financial ruin and unhappiness for Amy, but agrees to let them marry in the family home, and Frank Hyland, Clara's well-off husband, loans Aubrey money for their honeymoon. Eight months later, Amy and Aubrey must move from their small apartment because their building is being torn down. Amy still loves Aubrey but is so worried about money that she breaks down in front Ma. Meanwhile, the pompous Aubrey borrows Frank's car to go to an auto show, gets a parking ticket, then foolishly antagonizes a traffic cop and causes an accident in which the cop's arm is broken. Frank pays $1,000 to cover the costs, but Aubrey faces criminal prosecution for injuring a policeman. That night, the family learns that Pa Fisher has died of a stroke. Although still refusing to take responsibility for the accident or his financial failings, Aubrey tells Amy that, because he is now the head of the family, they should move in with Ma and Amy's brother Joe, a budding inventor. That same night, Aubrey sees a letter Joe has just received from Morgan and Jennings, two patent attorneys who are interested in an automobile process Joe has invented. A few days later, when Aubrey faces the judge, he is so impertinent and contemptuous that the judge increases his fine from $500 to $7,000, which Frank takes care of. Meanwhile, after Ma signs papers to receive Pa's life insurance, she and Clara talk about Aubrey, and Clara admits that she envies her sister because Aubrey is such a loving husband, while Frank, though an excellent provider, is too busy to pay much attention to her. After court, Aubrey goes to see Morgan and Jennings. When the lawyers tell him that they have already met with Joe and he signed a $50,000 contact with them, Aubrey insists that he is Joe's representative and would not think of allowing Joe to accept anything less than $100,000 and fifty percent of the profits from his invention. Aubrey's obnoxious bravado, and his threat that they can sell the invention to General Motors, so alienates Morgan and Jennings that they tell him he is detestable and they are no longer interested. For the first time, even Aubrey begins to realize the terrible effects of his actions. A short time later, Joe, who does not know that Aubrey went to the lawyers, arrives home and tells the family about his $50,000 contract. Aubrey tries to dismiss the contract, but just then a letter from Morgan and Jennings arrives with a check for $100,000 and an agreement to Aubrey's terms. Joe is so delighted over the windfall that he tells Aubrey he will be his partner in all future endeavors. Amy and Aubrey are overjoyed, but poor Ma can only say ""Lord help me from now on.""",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0021137/?ref_=sr_i_115,"['George Kelly', 'Herman J.

After enjoying a birthday banquet for the aged Major Manners amid much singing and revelry, Inspector Turner reveals suspicions about a new recruit, John Smith, whom he knows to be using a pseudonym and whose war record contains something potentially damaging. Smith is purported to have been a flyer during the war; he and his brother fell in love with the same girl who turned out to be a spy and to whom one of them revealed British Air Force secrets, which caused a squadron of planes to be attacked. John meets Freil, another Mountie, who gives him an encouraging talk about self-respect and unselfishness and promises never to dredge up the former's past record. Alice, Freil's daughter, returns home by canoe after visiting her ailing former nurse. When her canoe heads for the rapids, Smith rescues her, and Alice then promises to save a dance for him at a party that night at the lodge. During the festivities, as Turner and Alice dance, he confesses his love for her, as well as his jealousy of Smith, as he had witnessed the pair riding together after Alice's rescue. Smith cuts in, and the lovers take a walk in the moonlight. After the dance, Smith and Alice discuss a song she's given him, ""'Round My Kingdom's Door,"" and Smith begins to sing a few bars. Turner then arrives and announces that he's selected Smith for a dangerous solo mission to rescue an injured hunter from some snowy climes. Smith returns from his mission unscathed and tells Alice that he did not want to take the mission alone, contradicting Turner's earlier claim that Smith requested the mission in order to prove his bravery. Smith then goes to the police barracks and encounters Turner, who informs Smith that he has sent for his official war record but will remain silent about its contents if Smith resigns. Smith refuses, saying that he will tell Alice everything, but when Turner threatens to inform Smith's English family about their son's dishonorable history, Smith agrees to resign. Doyle, Smith's friend during the war and the man responsible for bringing him to the Royal Mounties' camp, promises to help his buddy out of his predicament. Alice hears of John's resignation and vows to stand by him despite his past, while Doyle assures her that anyone would have transgressed in his situation. As Alice is asking Turner about Smith, Turner receives a report of a forest fire in the same region that Freil has been traveling. Smith, an ace flier during the war, takes a plane into the area and rescues Freil, who then reprimands Turner for his earlier act of revenge and asks for his resignation. Alice reads Smith's war record and reports that the ""deplorable incident"" was actually Smith's attempt to shield his younger brother from blame. The record also reveals that his real name is Sir Robert Macklin. Alice and Macklin, now with a clean slate in the Canadian Royal Mounted Police community, marry at the Mounties' barracks and raise their glasses with the other men.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0021501/?ref_=sr_i_249,['Tom Barry'],['A.F.

Claire wants to get married. But, Stoddard, whom she cares for very much, has several proposals directed at her, none of which sound remotely like a marriage proposal; Claire tells him, in her straight-forward, no-nonsense manner that she wants to get married because, in her words: ""I'm running away from the doubts and uncertainty and problems of a woman who isn't married."" Stoddard thinks that nuptial bonds is a stupid old-fashioned tradition and fatal to romance. She says any man who says that is lying, and when she departs his suite at the crack of dawn, she seems convinced Stoddard indeed believes what he said he believed. But Claire has another option awaiting her...a Texan from home, and she promptly accepts his marriage proposal. But the house detective comes along after the ceremony and tells Tex his version of what he thinks goes on when a woman stays in a man's suite until the crack of dawn, and that doesn't jibe with his definition of a moral woman, and he ups and leaves her. Stoddard comes along and he thinks Tex has made a mockery of the marriage vows he took a short while ago, and he tells Claire that he will marry her, as soon as she can get an annulment from that day's ceremony, and they will make a go of it because they are 'different.' Somewhere in the 24-hour setting of this film, Claire plays a piano and sings a song called ""In My Dreams, You Still Belong To Me,"" and then does a tango with a partner; and then does a solo-dance performance, interpreting a bullfighter...in costume...in 2-strip Technicolor.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0021243/?ref_=sr_i_310,"['Carey Wilson', 'Wells Root', 'Frances Hyland']",['Marcel De Sano'],"['Mae Murray', 'George Barraud', 'Jason Robards Sr.', 'Richard Tucker', 'William L.
