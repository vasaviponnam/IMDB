Probably the most upstanding citizen in the area is Doc, a marine biologist who earns a living primarily by collecting and selling marine specimens for research. He is a lost soul who is looking for his place in life. He is running away from his past, one where he is trying to make amends for what he considers a past wrong. But his current life isn't totally satisfying either. He believes that his recent collection of eight baby octopi will help him define that future in conducting research on their behavior. However, he is finding that research is not as easy as he had hoped, and that he is still feeling restless. Into the area comes drifter Suzy DeSoto. She too is a lost soul. With few job skills, she gets a job as what she calls a floozy in the local whorehouse, despite her openly headstrong demeanor not making her well suited to the work. Doc and Suzy are immediately attracted to each other, but theirs is a clash of personalities, despite each truly liking the other. The other residents of Cannery Row do their part for a Doc/Suzy coupling, not always with successful results. Doc and Suzy will first have to find their own lot in life before they can commit to someone else, be it the other or anyone else.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083717/?ref_=sr_i_89,"['John Steinbeck', 'David S.

Escaping from under his grandmother's roof, Danny, in a step to achieve his goal as they have all his father's old professional paraphernalia, reunites with his Aunt Sibyl and Uncle Burke in the town of Harding where they have a mind-reading act, she who actually can read minds but which only impinges on the smoke and mirrors they've developed with the act itself. In his wanderings around Harding, Danny gets involved with corrupt Stu Qui√±ones, and indirectly with Stu's equally corrupt father, the town's mayor, Leon Qui√±ones. This father/son pair no longer associate with each other as although Stu aspires to be as corrupt as his father, Stu's activities are a little too brazen and public for a politician with which to deal. In those dealings, Danny devises what is largely seen as a publicity stunt in reality to get the one up on the Qui√±oneses, but in which he will have to show his true mettle as a great escape artist. In the process, Danny may also provide some justice for his father, the true nature of his death which Danny learns along the way.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083900/?ref_=sr_i_135,"['David Wagoner', 'Melissa Mathison', 'Stephen Zito']",['Caleb Deschanel'],"['Raul Julia', ""Griffin O'Neal"", 'Desi Arnaz', 'Teri Garr', 'Joan Hackett', 'Gabriel Dell', 'John P.

338. Parsifal,1982,4h 15m,PG,7.6,340,,"Richard Wagner's last opera has remained controversial since its first performance for its unique, and, for some, unsavory blending of religious and erotic themes and imagery. Based on one of the medieval epic romances of King Arthur and the search for the holy grail (the chalice touched by the lips of Christ at the last supper), it recounts over three long acts how a ""wild child"" unwittingly invades the sacred precincts of the grail, fulfilling a prophecy that only such a one can save the grail's protectors from a curse fallen upon them. Interpreters of the work have found everything from mystical revelation to proto-fascist propaganda in it. Hans-Jurgen Syberberg's production doesn't avoid either aspect, but tries synthesize them by seeking their roots in the divided soul of Wagner himself. The action unfolds on a craggy landscape which turns out to be a gigantic enlargement of the composer's death mask, among deliberately tatty theatrical devices: puppets, scale models, magic-lantern projections. The eponymous hero is sung by the specified tenor voice (Reiner Goldberg) but mimed on screen by a male and a female performer alternately, reflecting what the director takes to be the creator's own sexual conflicts. Syberberg's pacing, dictated by the majestic pace of Wagner's score, is slow, but enlivened by constant subtle shifts in point of view, and memorable performances by actress Edith Clever as the villainess/heroine Kundry (sung by Yvonne Minton), orchestra conductor Armin Jordan as the remorseful knight Amfortas (sung by Wolfgang Schoene), and Robert Lloyd (the faithful retainer Gurnemanz).",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084476/?ref_=sr_i_338,['Richard Wagner'],['Hans-J√ºrgen Syberberg'],"['Edith Clever', 'Martin Sperr', 'Robert Lloyd', 'Michael Kutter', 'Karin Krick', 'Aage Haugland', 'Armin Jordan', 'Rudolph Gabler', 'Urban von Klebelsberg', 'Bruno Romani-Versteeg']","DEM3,000,000 (estimated)",,,,"May 19, 1982","['West Germany', 'France']","['Bavaria Studios, Bavariafilmplatz 7, Geiselgasteig, Gr√ºnwald, Bavaria, Germany']","['TMS Film GmbH', 'Bayerischer Rundfunk (BR)', 'Gaumont']","Awards, 1 win & 1 nomination total","['Drama', 'Music']",['German']
