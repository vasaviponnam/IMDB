On re-issue, all of the entries underwent a title change from ""Hit Parade of 19??"" to, usually, a title of a song contained in the film, as happened in the case of this film when it was reissued as ""Change of Heart"" in 1949. Not re-issuing the film under the original title of ""Hit Parade of 1943"" had a two-fold purpose; the audiences of that era were not much interested in seeing a film twice, and a changed title - even when the original title was clearly shown in (very) small print in the ads and on the posters---had a chance of being seen again by that segment of the ticket-buying public who didn't read the small print. The plot here is just a trifle---Susan Hayward ghost writes songs for composer John Carroll, whose charms evidently outweighed his song-writing ability---played in and around some great singing and dancing numbers by, for its time, a large number of black performers including Dorothy Dandridge, Count Basie, dancing by the great Jack Williams and the team of ""Pops and Louie"" (Albert Whitman and Louis Williams) and others, including Spanish dancer Chinita Marin, billed as Chinita. The song ""Change of Heart"", by Jule Styne and Harold Adamson, was Oscar-nominated, and also became the title of the film on 1949 re-issue. Walter Scharf also was Oscar-nominated for Best Scoring of a Musical.

Jimmy, thinking Judy needs publicity in order to get a singing job on a radio program, thinks that a romance between her and the war hero would be just the ticket. Judy isn't too warm on the idea but agrees to go ahead for Jimmy's sake, with whom she thinks she is in love. She agrees to work on Buzz that night at the Manhattan Canteen, a converted night club where show business people entertain and wait on service men. Foggy is assigned to get pictures of Judy and Buzz together but fails through ineptness. Buzz escorts Judy home in a rainstorm and, while helping her out of the taxi, slips and falls into a deep puddle. Judy asks him to come in so she can dry his soaking-wet uniform on the kitchen stove. Foggy gains entrance to the apartment via the dumbwaiter and snaps a picture of Buzz in his underwear. The next morning Buzz tells Jimmy that he intends to marry Judy, which is going further than he had intended. He also decides he can't use the compromising - but innocent - photo for publicity purposes but does announce their - he thinks - publicity-only engagement. That clinches the deal for Judy to get a radio program called ""The Girl I Left Behind.""

He takes a cab driven by Dixie Dugan, who hopes that being a cabbie while the country's men are away fighting will help the war effort. Her incompetent driving, however, results in an accident for which Roger must take responsibility in order to reach the radio station in time. Dixie then returns home, where she lives with her father Timothy, who is constantly practicing his air raid warden duties, her mother Gladys, an aspiring Red Cross worker, and cousin Imogene, who studies incessantly to become a ""quiz kid."" The Dugans rent out their spare rooms to Dixie's fiance, Matt Hogan, and to blustering Judge J. J. Lawson. Matt, who works in a munitions factory, wants Dixie to settle down and marry him, but Dixie is determined to help her country. A few weeks previously, Dixie took a civil service exam and is thrilled when she finally receives an appointment. Unfortunately, the job is as secretary to Roger, who has never before had a woman secretary. Roger's dismay grows when he remembers Dixie from the car accident, but he is prevented from firing her because of her civil servant status. Roger's fiance, Jean Patterson, is jealous of Dixie, as Matt is of Roger, but the pair discover that they work well together. Pressure from Jean and Matt forces Roger to come up with a job that will take Dixie out of the office, and so he tells her to do a door-to-door survey of women to find out what would free them from family responsibilities and enable them to participate in more defense work. Although Dixie tackles her new task with much enthusiasm and writes a comprehensive report, Roger does not take her work seriously. Infuriated, Dixie accuses Roger of being a ""woman-belittler"" and a phony, then storms out of the office. Shamed into reading Dixie's report, Roger finds that it is filled with useful information and suggestions. Dixie refuses to return his calls, however, and Lawson takes advantage of the situation by setting up an interview for her with a newspaper editor who is out to ridicule Roger. While Lawson receives money for bringing in Dixie, Roger and his department are painted as money-draining wastes of time. After Dixie then negates the story and chastises Jean for her jealousy, Jean urges her father, Senator Ira Patterson, to discuss Dixie's report on his upcoming radio broadcast about the home-front. Dixie is hailed as a hero, while Lawson is arrested for draft evasion. Finally proud of Dixie's work, Matt listens with resignation as she accepts Roger's offer to accompany him to England to do survey of women there.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0035811/?ref_=sr_i_396,"['J.P.

At the Montgomery ranch, they are welcomed by the major and his daughter Bonnie, who hire them to ward off a gang of Schuyler's cutthroats, who while posing as homesteaders, have been waging a campaign of terror against the ranchers in an attempt to force them off their lands. Meanwhile, in Canyon City, Monte coerces Schuyler into making him a partner in his scheme to displace the ranchers. Although Steve tries to discredit Schuyler's men by exposing them as escaped convicts, he soon realizes that the fight is useless without the power of the law behind him. When Dave discovers the truth about his brother, Schuyler frames the ex-Ranger for murder and has him jailed. Steve and Arkansas come to Dave's rescue, and after breaking him out of jail, Steve rides to the state capitol and persuades the governor and a senate committee to reinstate the Rangers. Leading his troop of Rangers, Steve then rides back to Canyon City to confront Schuyler and his gang. In the ensuing shootout, Monte is mortally wounded while shielding his brother, and before dying, confesses that Schuyler framed Dave on the murder charge. After the Rangers capture Schuyler and his gang, law and order is restored to Canyon City, and Dave and Bonnie ride off together.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0035961/?ref_=sr_i_451,['Gerald Geraghty'],['William Berke'],"['Charles Starrett', 'Arthur Hunnicutt', 'Robert Owen Atcher', 'Leota Atcher', 'Norman Willis', 'Lloyd Bridges', 'Ted Adams', 'Ernie Adams', 'Tom London', 'Davison Clark']",,,,,"September 15, 1943",['United States'],,['Columbia Pictures'],,"['Drama', 'Western']",['English']

Parrot tries to persuade Al to let his sister, Arline Harris, sing on the program but Al resists. During the program, a parrot used in the commercial announcements repeats derogatory remarks made by band leader Joe Maxwell about the finance company's terms. As a result, the show is cut off the air and Al and his group, most of whom are in debt to Parrot, are immediately fired. Joe wants to return to New York where his girl friend, Jean Foster, is secretary to P. J. Ellis, president of the Federal Broadcasting System. Al and his fiance, beauty salon operator Glenda Forbes, however, want to remain where they are. During a phone conversation, Jean tells Joe that she has been trying to get a singing job with the Jan Garber band, and also advises him that a new nightclub could hire his band. Joe agrees to accept the engagement, then arranges for Al to receive a phony telegram inviting the group to appear regularly on Ellis' network, and Al reluctantly agrees to leave Glenda behind. After tricking Arline into advancing everyone's fare by promising her that she can join the band as a singer, they all head to New York. En route, Al tells a reporter that they have been engaged by FBS to do a weekly series. Mr. Postelwaite, Ellis' assistant, reads this and, in his boss's absence, arranges a welcoming party for Al and company, at which Arline informs two gossip columnists that she and Al are engaged. When Ellis returns and denies hiring Al, Joe's trick is revealed and Jean walks out on him. Meanwhile, Glenda reads about Al's engagement and goes to New York, where she and Jean try to find Al, who has disappeared. Al, who has taken a job as a vacuum cleaner salesman, is assigned to work with salesman Elmer Blurt, to whom Al bears a striking resemblance. As Al pursues his new job, Joe and the band rehearse for the new club's opening. When a new FBS sponsor announces that he is looking for artists for a variety program, Jean decides to send him an audition tape of Joe's band by tricking nightclub owner Louie Burch into thinking that the recording engineer is actually broadcasting his club's opening. Al is found in time for the broadcast and is about to perform his master of ceremonies duties when Parrot shows up to repossess the band's instruments. Jean calls Jan Garber in the nick of time, however, and he agrees to help out. During the show, Al impersonates Elmer as part of a comedy routine, and is knocked out. When he regains consciousness, he has become Elmer and wanders away to resume his selling career. He later becomes Al again after being arrested for disturbing the peace. Mistaking him for Elmer, the real Elmer's boss then asks him to find Al and collect his merchandise. At the Same time, Joe and Glenda locate Elmer and, thinking that he is Al, take him to be examined by a doctor and placed in the care of a male nurse. Believing Elmer to be Al, Arline persuades him to marry her and helps him to escape. Meanwhile, Al is telling a judge that he cannot remember anything and the charge of disturbing the peace is dismissed. Back at the radio station, the new sponsor is impressed by the audition recording and wants Al and company to start broadcasting immediately. After Arline and Elmer get married and check into a hotel, Elmer tells her that he has no knowledge of ever being Al. When Al returns to the same hotel and is greeted by Jean with news of the contract, he meets Arline at an elevator and she convinces him that they are married. Glenda, meanwhile, encounters a dazed Elmer in the hotel corridor and thinks that he is Al. After Al goes to tell Glenda about Arline, she and Arline have a fight. When Elmer wanders away again, Joe and Jean spot him on the street and, thinking that he is Al, drag him off to the radio studio, but he escapes again just as Al for the broadcast. Arline barges into the studio and demands to sing on the program. Arline is a hit as a comic singing talent, but as Al and Glenda reunite, she is stunned to discover that she is married to Elmer.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0035987/?ref_=sr_i_503,"['Jack Townley', 'Stanley Davis']",['Joseph Santley'],"['Al Pearce', 'Dale Evans', 'Frank Albertson', 'Gloria Stuart', 'Wally Vernon', 'Nick Cockrane', 'Will Wright', 'Thurston Hall', 'Ben Welden', 'Chester Clute']",,,,,"November 15, 1943",['United States'],"['Republic Studios, Hollywood, Los Angeles, California, USA']",['Republic Pictures (I)'],,['Comedy'],['English']

After dinner, the couples recall the events leading to their arrival in Elmdale twenty years before: Mike is the proprietor of a popular speakeasy, at which Ann is the featured singer. Steve and Joe are Mike's ""muscle,"" while Helen is Ann's accompanist and Kitty is a cigarette girl. Mike is engaged in a power struggle with Al Malone, a racketeer who wants to take over the speakeasy. Mike repulses Malone's warlike tactics, but Ann, fearful for Mike's safety and desirous of a quiet life together, warns him that she will leave him if he does not get out of the business. Realizing that Ann is the most important thing in his life, Mike decides to go straight and gives the speakeasy to Pete, one of his men. Steve and Joe also decide to settle down with Kitty and Helen, and the three couples move to Elmdale, where they live prosperous, contented lives. Their reminiscences over, the friends part for the evening, and later, Reverend Hamilton visits Mike. The reverend asks Mike if he can help solve the problem of Mr. Hugo, who runs a casino just outside the city limits. Mike agrees to help, and as he is mulling over the situation, Joe, who is a grocer, and Steve, who is a barber, are confronted by Hugo's thugs. Unknown to the reverend, Hugo also runs a protection racket and has been shaking down the town's merchants. The matter becomes more complicated when Jerry, Joe and Helen's grown son, is beaten up by Hugo's thugs for nonpayment of his gambling debts. Mike's son Bill tries to help his pal Jerry and is also roughed up. When Bill confesses the source of his bruises to Mike, Mike gathers up Joe and Steve and visits Hugo's casino, where he offers to buy the casino for a handsome profit if Hugo will leave Elmdale. Hugo laughs and has the three men thrown out, after which they grimly begin to exercise and get themselves back in shape so that they can fight the gangsters on their terms. Ann, Helen and Kitty become suspicious of their husband's unusual activities and quickly learn the truth of their involvement with Hugo. Much to the men's surprise, however, their wives encourage them to protect the children and rid the town of Hugo. Finally in shape, Mike, Steve and Joe return to Hugo's casino and make short work of their opponents. During the fracas, however, Pete, who is now working with Hugo, appears and tells Hugo the secret of Mike's past. Hugo then reveals all to the reverend when he arrives, but Hamilton eases Mike's fears by telling him that the people of Elmdale have always known about his past but respected him for having the strength to change.

She ultimately leaves the Convent and the nuns who cared for her, in order to marry a handsome and successful engineer. The couple's marital bliss is cut short when they find they cannot conceive children. After having an extramarital affair, the husband fathers a girl with the other woman. While hurt by his infidelity at first, this wife recovers and both soon realize that they could raise this baby as their own daughter, while allowing the biological mother to avoid the shame and stigma of having a child out of wedlock. This convenient solution seems as if it was tailor-made and heaven-sent. This mutually advantageous and seemingly harmless lie works out well through the years, as their daughter grows into a beautiful young woman in her own right. Just as she is about to marry her own true love, the poor girl finally discovers the awful truth. Consequently, she feels that she must now go live with her birth mother, especially after being lied to for so long by those who raised her. Worst of all, she is suddenly forced to come to grips with the fact that she is really an illegitimate child, born out of wedlock, as the result of an adulterous affair.
