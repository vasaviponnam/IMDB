To further complicate the daily rigors of teenage life, her father, Robert, an advertising executive who has since rebuilt his business, tries to do the same with his relationship with his daughter. Against his therapist's advice, overeager Robert tries really hard to get close to Tennie by showing his own way of caring. He tries to find out about his daughter's personal life with the help of his newly appointed, 19 year-old driver/intern, Jack. Practically being raised by her extended family, Tennie although very academically inclined and mature for her age, with compassion for others, she's got a touch of sarcasm, and a hint of rebelliousness. After she catches on to her father's plan, Tennie realizes that in order to get her father off of her back, she needs to convince him to find a lady friend. She recruits her friends to create an online dating profile in order to introduce her father to potential companions. Little did she know that her father already was seeing someone that he was not yet ready to introduce to her. Things escalate when Robert gets Tennie's friends from school to participate in a focus group for a project, and in retaliation, Tennie throws a party at the house with almost half of the school showing up.

Lydia Lunch: The War Is Never Over,2019,1h 15m,,6.8,169,,"LYDIA LUNCH - The War Is Never Over by Beth B is the first career-spanning documentary retrospective of Lydia Lunch's confrontational, acerbic and always electric artistry. As New York City's preeminent No Wave icon from the late '70s, Lunch has forged a lifetime of music and spoken word performance devoted to the utter right of any woman to indulge, seek pleasure, and to say ""fuck you!"" as loud as any man. In this time of endless attacks on women this is a rallying cry to acknowledge the only thing that is going to bring us together - ART...as the universal salve to all of our traumas.

LYDIA LUNCH - The War is Never Over by Beth B is the first career-spanning documentary retrospective of Lydia Lunch's confrontational, acerbic and always electric artistry. As New York City's preeminent No Wave icon from the late '70s, Lunch has forged a lifetime of music and spoken word performance devoted to the utter right of any woman to indulge, seek pleasure, and to say ""fuck you!"" as loud as any man. In this time of endless attacks on women this is a rallying cry to acknowledge the only thing that is going to bring us together - ART...as the universal salve to all of our traumas.

In 2017, Lydia Lunch and filmmaker Beth B joined forces to create LYDIA LUNCH - The War Is Never Over a retrospective of Lunch's confrontational, acerbic and always electric spoken word performance and music. The film frames Lunch's work through the lens of the various philosophical themes that have obsessed her for years to enlighten and empower women to voice the unheard and to break the cycle of violence toward women throughout the world. Lydia Lunch is the psycho-sexual transgressive who revoked patriarchal expectations of what a female performer might mean, while forging a vocabulary of rare emotional honesty, philosophy and humor.

Director Beth B has known and worked with No Wave legend Lydia Lunch since the late '70s when they broke boundaries in New York City, confronting audiences with uncensored poetry, music and films. Reflecting on the groundbreaking defiance Lydia Lunch has personified for over 30 years, she is a survivor who creates a dialogue of universal truth through her music and performances. In 1984, she penned the subversive and prescient spoken word piece, ""Daddy Dearest"", defying the gag order and spoke out about the sexual abuse she suffered as a young girl at the hands of her father. Lunch continues to expose the patriarchy, sexual abuse, the cycle of violence, and corporate greed with stubborn resistance.

In 1976, at age sixteen, Lydia Lunch arrived in the bankrupted ruins of NYC with the killer instincts of a born survivor, inspired by the ravings of Lester Bangs in Creem Magazine, the Velvet Underground's sarcastic wit, the glamour of the New York Dolls, and the poetic scat of Patti Smith's Piss Factory. Having escaped a disrupted and abusive childhood, Lunch's refusal to submit to anyone's will led her to forge her own reality on stage with the unprecedented brutality of Teenage Jesus And The Jerks - a central pillar of the No Wave music scene and a legendary name to this day. Everyone from Alan Vega and Martin Rev (Suicide), to the future luminaries of Sonic Youth, would embrace Lunch as the violent heartbeat of their art/music rebellion. When Brian Eno chose to produce the No New York compilation of 1978, Lunch was there as the shrieking voice and guitar fronting one of the most influential bands of the era: Teenage Jesus And The Jerks.

LYDIA LUNCH - The War is Never Over includes interviews with Lydia Lunch as well as some of her collaborators and colleagues including: Thurston Moore of Sonic Youth; performance artist Kembra Pfahler; Teenage Jesus bass player, Jim Sclavunos; Donita Sparks from L7; famed DJ and musician Nicolas Jaar; Art Critic Carlo McCormick; Filmmaker Richard Kern and a long list of other groundbreaking artists connected to Lunch's past and present.

Filming in rehearsal and on tour with her band Retrovirus, the behind-the-scenes footage reveals a side of Lunch's personality that has been unseen. Her warmth and generosity in private interactions along with hilarious banter in the rehearsal studio with band members contrasts wonderfully with her brash, assaultive style of performance.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10367856/?ref_=sr_i_493,"['Ron Athey', 'Bob Bert', 'Tim Dahl']",['Beth B'],"['Ron Athey', 'Bob Bert', 'Tim Dahl', 'Nicolas Jaar', 'Richard Kern', 'Lydia Lunch', 'Carlo McCormick', 'Thurston Moore', 'Kembra Pfahler', 'Henry Rollins']",,"$1,710","$12,948","$12,948","November 9, 2019",['United States'],,,"Awards, 1 nomination total",['Documentary'],['English']

544. Bill Traylor: Chasing Ghosts,2019,1h 15m,,7.0,33,80.0,"An inventive feature documentary capturing the vivid life of Bill Traylor, who in his late 80s, living homeless on the street in the thriving segregated black neighborhood of Montgomery, produced a body of extraordinary art. Born into slavery in 1853 on a cotton plantation in rural Alabama, Traylor witnessed profound social and political change during his life spanning slavery, Reconstruction, Jim Crow segregation, and the Great Migration. In his later years, Traylor poured out those memories from within, drawing and painting over 1,000 pieces of art from 1939-42. Using historic and cultural context, the film is designed to bring the spirit and mystery of Traylor's incomparable art to life. The transcendent surprise is while Traylor kept to himself leading an unassuming life, he was nurturing a remarkable creative gift that would not be expressed for decades. Tap dance, evocative period and original music, and dramatic readings are used in surprising ways in the film, balanced with insightful perspectives from Traylor family members and expert interviews. Traylor devised his own visual language to record the stories of his life, translating an oral culture into something unique, powerful, and culturally rooted. The film reflects a tumultuous time of a forgotten world and its marginalized people, still reverberating today. A new lynching memorial and Legacy Museum recently opened in Montgomery just blocks from where Bill Traylor used to sit and work. Bill Traylor: Chasing Ghosts explores the life of a unique American artist, a man with a remarkable and unlikely biography. The film is a compelling human narrative that gives voice to a man who endures a long life of extreme hardships during an era of legalized racial indignities, to become one of America's most prominent artists, exhibited in museums and collections worldwide.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9108510/?ref_=sr_i_544,['Fred Barron'],['Jeffrey Wolf'],"['Russell G.
