He devotes his great talents to writing a shockingly blasphemous book, debunking all religion, and then embarks on a trip to Jerusalem. Far from reconciling him to God, the sight of all the different sects worshipping in that ancient city only serves to embitter him and deepen his unbelief. One day, wandering in the country, he loses his way and stops to ask directions at a small house. The inhabitants are a poor but devout family whose daughter, Ruth, revives his broken heart. At the risk of losing her, he confesses to her his loss of faith, and she gently declares that meditation on the Gospels will heal him. He sorrowfully tells her that he wishes he could believe as she does, but it is impossible. Exhausted by the discussion, Powers falls asleep and in a dream witnesses the entire panorama of the Old Testament, from the Garden of Eden through the prophets and the kings. In his dream, he repents; he then awakes, his faith restored.

Pop Schmidt didn't understand the young girl's need for a nicer home, and although Mom did, she couldn't persuade Pop to make the change. Pop had it all planned that she was to marry Peter Halitovsky, who sold sausages. Then, at a dance, Fernie met Jack Dugan. It was a case of love at first sight. But Fernie couldn't bring Jack home to meet her parents, because of those two ill-smelling rooms back of their business. So, when he returned home from the dance, Po, who had been inflamed by Peter's recital of Fernie's rejecting him, demanded why she hadn't brought her new friend home. She explained that she couldn't bring him to such a place. Infuriated, Pop put her out of his home. Fernie went to work in a department store. Her affair with Jack progressed, and one Sunday, at a picnic, he proposed. He was going to buy a business, he explained, so he would be able to take care of Fernie. Fernie accepted Jack. That same night, she went home to dinner at Pop's invitation. He had finally decided to buy a new home, but back of his decision lurked a wish for Fernie to marry Peter. Peter proposed, and Fernie was about to reject him, when Jack appeared unexpectedly. When he told her that he had bought a delicatessen store, Fernie was happy that she could help him. Pop and Mom were immediately won over by Jack's manliness, and Mom began to plan the wedding.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0017002/?ref_=sr_i_365,"['Brooke Hanlon', 'Julien Josephson', 'Rob Wagner']",['Alfred E.
