101. Rockin' in the Rockies,1945,1h 3m,Approved,5.8,410,,"While Rusty Williams is away at college, he leaves his cousin, Shorty Williams, in charge of his large ranch. Shorty, more concerned with his prospecting ambitions, wanders into town looking for backers. At the Wagon Wheel Cafe, he encounters a couple of vagrants, Curly and Larry, who are just a step or two ahead of Sheriff Zeke, who have won some money at the roulette wheel and they immediately become prime prospects for backing Shorty's nebulous prospecting scheme. Meanwhile, June McGuire and Betty Vale, whose singing act has failed at the café, are packing for New York. Shorty, who has fallen for Betty, persuades the girls to go to the ranch. Meanwhile, back at the ranch, Rusty has returned with intentions of selling the ranch. He tells Shorty, Curly and Larry to hit the trail, and instructs his cowhands, the Hoosier Hotshots, to round up the cattle for the buyer's inspection the next morning. Shorty, Curly and Larry inadvertently (of course) make a hole in the fence and the cattle get out. The only-slightly smarter Hotshots suspect rustlers and when they come upon Sam Clemens, the prospective buyer, they hand him over to the sheriff as a rustler. They hear that Tom Trove, a Broadway producer, is in town and get him to the ranch where they plan to audition their talents. Rusty gets the more-than-miffed Clemens out of jail and they return to the ranch to find a show in progress with Trove as a disgruntled audience. Things aren't going good for anybody at the old ranch house, until Curly spills some rocks from his pocket that turn out to be that most valuable and rare mineral ""Vanadanite,"" and the ranch is loaded with it. Clemens makes Rusty his partner in a mining venture, and the Hoosier Hotshots, with the unintentional aid (of course) of Shorty, Curly and Larry, make a hit with Trove, who signs them for his Diamond Circle in New York, and includes June and Betty.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0038033/?ref_=sr_i_101,"['J.

In a chess game, John facetiously outlines to Fred how he would murder him if he chose to. Fred, decides to beat him to the punch and enters his bedroom that night and attempts to kill John with a poker. The figure in the bed turns out to be a dummy and John, who has been hiding, clubs Fred to death.

Tim Colby, the owner of the club, has other plans for Penelope; he hopes to make her his wife. When she rejects his proposal, Tim suggests that Penelope go home for the weekend and think it over, despite the fact that her childhood beau, noted symphony conductor Geoffry Cabot, is returning to Connecticut at the same time. Like Penelope, Geoffry is secretly hooked on swing music, and longs to give up his classical career to play jazz trumpet. Penelope arrives at her family home with Pat Cameron, her friend and accompanist, just as Geoffry is addressing the local symphony society, which is headed by her aunt Jessica and uncle Rufus. Although the former sweethearts are initially cool to each other, things between the two heat up after Penelope sings for the group and Geoffry offers her a position with the symphony. Seeing Penelope kissing Geoffry, Penelope's relatives assume they are back together and announce their engagement. With two months left on her contract with Tim, Penelope manages to convince Jessica and Rufus to delay the wedding by claiming that she and Geoffry need to get reacquainted as well as prepare for the symphony opening. Meanwhile, Mrs. Bradstreet convinces her banker husband to withdraw his $20,000 donation to the symphony after Geoffry insults her singing, causing its possible cancellation. Geoffry is delighted by this turn of events, as cancellation would void his contract and allow him to start up his own jazz band. Penelope, however, goes to New York and borrows the necessary money from Tim, who is unaware of why she needs it. Hoping to break up Geoffry and Penelope by exposing her secret career, Tim invites Geoffry and the Marimans to Club Colby. Although Geoffry is delighted to learn about Penelope's jazz life, the singer thinks that he has brought her family to the club to embarrass her. Learning that Penelope, in a fit of anger, has agreed to elope with Tim, Pat tricks the nightclub owner into going to the Marimans while Geoffry heads for the justice of the peace.

By the time he is an adult, he has lost several insurance jobs because of his failure to allow others to speak, and his current employer has given him only one more chance to prove himself, by signing the president of the Green Network Broadcasting Company, J. B. Kindell. Gabby sneaks into Kindell's private sauna and appears to the president as an apparition in the steam, whispering about disease and accidents. Kindell, convinced he has been visited by a spirit to warn him about impending doom, runs for his doctor, after which Gabby steals his tickets to that night's football game and sneaks out. At the football game, Gabby grabs the microphone from the KPQ radio station announcer and launches into an impromptu play-by-play commentary. His rapid-fire patter is heard by KPQ's president, H. I. Bailey, and his daughter Margie, who insists her father hire him immediately to add energy to the failing station. Bailey soon is distracted by a phone call from Kindell, demanding to buy out the station, and the audition of talented singer Lorna Gray. When Gabby is brought from the game to the station to be hired, he interrupts Lorna's song by talking incessantly to Bailey. Lorna runs out angrily, but Gabby follows and convinces her to sing during half-time at the game he is to announce that night. Although Lorna is a big hit, Bailey turns off the radio after the first half and misses her performance. The next morning, after the ""Advice to the Lovelorn"" announcer quits, Bailey chooses Gabby to substitute for him, and Gabby hires Lorna as his secretary. As they work on the scripts for the show, Lorna's psychology background helps her to write brilliantly, and soon Gabby becomes a huge success, while his relationship with Lorna blooms. One day, sponsor Lester Westerchester refuses to commit to the station unless Gabby signs a long-term contract, but Gabby refuses, hoping to use his new fame as leverage to finagle an audition for Lorna. At a nightclub the next night, Gabby manages to get Lorna on stage, but accidentally starts a fight in the audience which once again drowns out her singing, and she runs out. Although fan letters pour in for Gabby at the station, he is so heartsick because of Lorna's ongoing absence that he cannot perform, and instead pretends to have laryngitis. Kindell, who has heard Gabby's voice on the radio and recognized it as that of his guardian spirit, arrives in an attempt to woo him to the Green Network, while all the stockholders also visit in the hopes of meeting him. While the doctors give Gabby a sedative, Margie calls Lorna to inform her of Gabby's plight, and when Lorna arrives and finds him passed out, she worriedly declares her love to him. When Gabby wakes and kisses her, she believes it has all been a ruse and stalks out. Gabby follows, attracting Kindell, Margie and Bailey, who fight over him in the hallway. Gabby suggests a merger of KPQ and the Green Network, and as the two presidents shake hands on the deal, Gabby insists that his ""wife"" be allowed to audition. Although Lorna is angry, she melts under his kisses, and years later, they watch in horror and pride as their three-month old baby begins to talk incessantly.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0037808/?ref_=sr_i_269,"['Henry Blankfort', 'Nathanael West', 'Lester Pine']",['Leslie Goodwins'],"['Lee Tracy', 'Brenda Joyce', 'Raymond Walburn', 'June Preisser', 'Thomas Gomez', 'Howard Freeman', 'Lorin Raker', 'Janet Shaw', 'Pierre Watkin', 'Peter Potter']",,,,,"June 8, 1945",['United States'],"['Universal Studios - 100 Universal City Plaza, Universal City, California, USA (Studio)']",['Universal Pictures'],,['Comedy'],['English']

Mistaking Gustav for Bruce Tyler, Judy shows the watchman her designs, and though he recognizes her talent, he advises her to return home to Maine. Gustav then realizes that it is his birthday, and the two put on some costumes and go to a nightclub. Their good time is interrupted, however, when Bruce arrives, but they manage to escape detection with the help of Phillipe, the nightclub's maitre d'. Like Cinderella, Judy leaves behind part of her costume, a bracelet, which Bruce finds and cradles like a glass slipper. The next morning Bruce meets with musical revue producer Billingsly Billings and his star, Helene Ford, to go over the latest designs by Tyler's couturier, Antonio. Judy is nearly fired when she tries to show Bruce her designs during the meeting, but he takes a fancy to her later that night. Jealous of Bruce's attentions toward Helene, Judy decides to prove herself by redesigning the singer's gown. In order to protect Judy, Gustav then falsely confesses to changing the costume himself. Just as Bruce is about to fire him, Helene puts on the gown and proclaims that she will wear only clothes designed by Gustav. Though Gustav wants to tell Bruce the truth, Judy suggests that they work together to design Helene's gowns under his name. Soon thereafter, Judy finally captures Bruce's heart, only to be falsely accused of stealing Gustav's designs and selling them to another design house. While the love-struck Bruce chases after Judy, Gustav confesses all to Billings. Upon his return, they try to tell Bruce the truth about Judy, but he is so angry at her rejection of him that he refuses to listen to even the mention of her name. Before she can return to Maine, Gustav convinces Judy to go to opening night of Gustav's show in order to see her costume on stage.

Sharon is afraid that Fred will be killed by gambler Joe Sapphire, to whom he has amassed a large debt. Sharon also confides that she is in love with her husband's business partner, Stephen Mason, and that she wants to keep her husband alive so that Stephen will not be suspected if Fred is murdered by Sapphire. When Jerry asks Sapphire to call off his hit on Fred, Sapphire tells Jerry that Fred has paid him in full, and that the money was the exact amount reported stolen from the Tiger Club's safe a week earlier. A short time later, Sharon and Stephen find the dead body of her husband, along with a suicide note instructing Sharon to collect Fred's life insurance money. While Sharon unthinkingly touches a gun on Fred's desk, Stephen burns the note so that the suicide clause on Fred's insurance will not invalidate Sharon's claim. Suspicion soon falls on Sapphire, who later accuses Jerry of setting him up. At the coroner's inquest, Inspector Henry Leggett testifies that Fred was shot at close range, and Mr. White, a representative from the insurance company, suggests that Fred killed himself. Rosie Gargan, a cleaning woman at Fred's office, then testifies that she saw a woman enter Fred's office around the time of the murder. The jury rules the death a murder, and Sharon receives a check for $100,000 from the insurance company. Jerry grows increasingly suspicious of Sharon, however, and decides to pressure Stephen into confessing. Jerry's persistence wears on Stephen, until Sharon, who is actually the murderer, realizes that she is in danger of being exposed. Luring Stephen up to Fred's office, Sharon pushes him out of the window and he falls to his death. The police believe that Stephen killed himself out of remorse for murdering Fred, but Jerry is even more convinced of Sharon's guilt, and in order to prove it, begins courting her. Jerry persuades Sharon to accompany him on a trip, but during the train ride, Sharon realizes that Jerry is only seeking evidence to convict her. Aiming a gun at him, Sharon confesses to Jerry that his suspicions about her are correct. Before Sharon can shoot him, however, the police spring out from their hiding places, as Jerry had arranged, and arrest her.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0274965/?ref_=sr_i_394,"['George Carleton Brown', 'John Dunkel']",['Philip Ford'],"['Adele Mara', 'Kane Richmond', 'Richard Fraser', 'Peggy Stewart', 'Cy Kendall', 'Gregory Gaye', 'John Kelly', 'Beverly Lloyd', 'Addison Richards', 'Donia Bussey']",,,,,"November 16, 1945",['United States'],"['Republic Studios, Hollywood, Los Angeles, California, USA (Studio)']",['Republic Pictures (I)'],,"['Film Noir', 'Crime', 'Drama']",['English']

Back in his room, Ira remembers the beginning of his relationship with Sally in California: Eighteen-year-old mechanic Ira meets seventeen-year-old Sally Sawyer, an aspiring actress, while she is dating his friend, Johnny Cole. Soon Ira and Sally have fallen in love, and three weeks after meeting, they elope to Nevada and are married. Ira's parents warmly welcome Sally into the family and fix up a cottage behind the house for the couple. On Sally's eighteenth birthday, Ira plans an evening alone for the two, but when Sally returns home late, she brings her gang of friends with her. Ira's surly attitude soon drives the gang away, and after they leave, Ira and Sally quarrel bitterly. Hoping to improve the marriage, Ira suggests that they move to Laguna, where he has been offered a job. The couple is happy for a while, but one night when Ira returns from work, he finds Sally's gang visiting. Ira is again rude to them, and this time, leaves Sally for good. As he remembers these events, Ira realizes that Sally must have known she was pregnant the night he left. Later, Major Bruce, Ira's commanding officer, recommends a short leave for the distracted soldier. As soon as Ira arrives in Burbank, he contacts Sally. Although Sally is happy to see him, Ira suspiciously prods her for information about her nice apartment and her late hours. He then demands to know where his son is. Sally responds that she does not know and would prefer for the boy to stay with the family who has cared for him for the last three years. Ira refuses to accept this and tries everything he can think of to find his son. Finally, Johnny introduces Ira to judge Benjamin Boller, who questions Ira carefully before agreeing to help him, although he warns Ira that he will only act in the child's best interest. The following day, while Ira visits his family, Boller talks to Sally. Ira returns to Boller's office while she is there and listens as she explains her state of mind when the baby was born. When Ira reveals that he saw a naval officer enter her apartment with a key and accuses her of living with him, Sally explains that she lives with the officer's wife, her co-worker on the night shift at the parachute factory, while her husband is away at war. Boller asks Sally if she would return to Ira if it meant she could have her son back, but she responds that they are still unsuited. Boller then tells Ira that although Sally was wrong to give up the child without his consent, he has failed in his obligations too and has no right to upset the child's life. Later, Ira apologizes to Sally for the way he acted when they were married and asks her for a fresh start.

On his way out, Hendricks, the producer, asks him for money, and though Riley protests that Bill has already secretly invested $34,000 into the show, Bill reveals to Riley that he has done so in the hope that it will fail and Roberta will come home again. At a penny arcade that day, tattoo artist Terry O'Farrell asks Bill to watch his charge, a little girl named Sally, while he talks to the welfare ladies, who insist that he get a more appropriate job. Bill immediately adores Sally. On the opening night of the play, Roberta fails miserably and Bill orders it to be closed. Although Tony urges Roberta to keep trying, she leaves with Bill. They then enjoy a romantic night and plan a second honeymoon, but just as they are leaving for the trip, Tony arrives. He offers Roberta a starring role in his new play and, when Bill objects, tells Roberta that Bill was the old play's backer and tried to force it to fail. In an argument, Bill tells Roberta that she is a poor actress, after which she leaves angrily with Tony, who asks her to donate her own money to the production. A few weeks later, Riley visits Roberta and tells her that Bill is sick and losing all his clients, thus causing Roberta to run home. At home, Bill realizes that in a drunken stupor, he has hired Terry as a butler, professed his love to Terry's friend Marge, and moved them and Sally into the apartment. He tries to hide this from a now-loving Roberta, but she finds Marge's clothes and suspects him of cheating. Visiting his office to ask for a divorce a few days later, Roberta sees a governess arrive for an interview, and deduces that Bill has had a child behind her back. She then disguises herself as a French nurse named Fleurette to infiltrate the apartment and get proof of his infidelity. Bill recognizes her right away but still hires her, hoping she will fall in love with Sally and want to stay. After a rough start, Roberta does come to love Sally, but still mistrusts Bill and decides to seduce him, as Fleurette, while Tony hides and takes pictures. Seeing Tony on the roof, Bill has Roberta drink the stiff cocktail intended for him, then romances her as she gets drunk. Later, when it begins to rain, he has the roof door locked to keep Tony from getting inside. The next morning, Terry, who does not know that ""Fleurette"" is really Bill's wife, finds Roberta passed out on the couch with a tender note from Bill, and, suspecting Bill of immorality, takes Sally and leaves. Upon waking, Roberta is distraught and calls the police to track down Terry and Sally as she dismisses the protests of a wet Tony. Bill and Riley rush home to talk with the detective while the police drag in Terry, Sally and Marge. In order to convince Terry to stay, Roberta takes off her disguise, then Bill reveals that he knew all along who she was, and compliments her on her acting talent.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0037886/?ref_=sr_i_418,"['Art Arthur', 'Albert S.

Although Linda tries to schedule the audition on a day when Junior's notoriously negative assistant, Bailey, is out of the office, Bailey turns up unexpectedly during the tryout and advises Junior not to hire them. Junior, distracted by news of a lawsuit brought by from his ex-girl friend, chorus girl Irma King, is easily swayed by Bailey and, after the audition, his lawyer, Dick Ryan, encourages him to leave town for a month while the settlement is postponed. Linda, feeling guilty that the Davises are now unemployed and discouraged, allows them to stay at Junior's now empty apartment. The siblings realize that their new, swank residence will project an image of success to other producers, and begin to attend industry parties, pretending to be established musicians. One night, Dick, who has worked too late to drive all the way to his Long Island home, decides to sleep at Junior's apartment. Linda, who is there visiting, quickly hides the Davises in the closet and tells Dick she is working for Junior, but Dick soon discovers Patty in the bedroom. Linda lies that Patty is actually Irma, and Dick, anxious to help Junior avoid the legal battle, sets out to encourage her to drop the suit. Patty, pretending to be Irma, agrees to drop all charges in exchange for a chance at a singing career. Dick loves Linda but nonetheless begins to take ""Irma"" out each night to introduce her to theater producers. At the same time, however, he is puzzled by the attempts of Irma's lawyer, Brewster, to reach him, as he assumes that she has informed him that the suit has been dropped. When he tries to ask Patty about this one night at the apartment, she arranges for her brothers to ring the doorbells repeatedly in order to distract Dick until he forgets his question. Soon after, Dick plans a party at Junior's in order to introduce Irma to reporter Ferdy Pelham, who can advance her career. That night, Brewster finally reaches Dick and, upon hearing about the party, questions the real Irma about it. Irma, furious, attends the party at the same time that Bailey, who wants to use the apartment secretly for a poker game, arrives. Minutes later, Junior, having returned home early, also enters. Irma denounces Patty and starts a fistfight, which culminates in Junior getting knocked out.

473. Captain Tugboat Annie,1945,1h 10m,Approved,6.3,26,,"On the day that the U.S. government relaxes wartime restrictions and allows tugboats to return to work, Alec Severn, the proprietor of Secoma Towing & Salvage, desperately searches for Tugboat Annie Brennan, the captain of his fleet. Wanting to replace Annie, his longtime nemesis, rival captain Bullwinkle gives Severn an incorrect address for Annie. The indomitable Annie nonetheless reaches Severn's office just in time and signs a new contract with him. Annie then hires her crew, all of whom are veterans: Pinto and Shiftless, who worked with Annie before the war; a newcomer named Missouri Jones; and Johnny Webb, who was injured while saving the lives of the other three men in combat. Soon after Annie begins work with her crew, they are interrupted by the appearance of Susan Henley, an orphan whose father used to work for Severn. Susan, a violin prodigy, wishes to stay with Annie, who wants to adopt her, but Severn convinces Annie that Susan would be better off living with his family. Annie still pines for a child, however, so Severn arranges with Judge Abbott for her to adopt one of the juvenile delinquent boys under his jurisdiction. On the day of her ""son's"" arrival, Annie is dismayed that the ""boy"" sent to her is Terry Jordan, a young veteran on probation for beating the man who swindled Terry's now-deceased mother while he was fighting overseas. The hostile Terry rejects Annie's friendly advances, and his treatment of Annie does not endear him to her crew either. Later, Annie and Marion Graves, Abbott's secretary, arrange for Susan to make her debut with famed conductor Alfred Puccini, a womanizer whom Annie knew when he was the ordinary Al Pucci. In order to prevent Pucci from discovering that Susan is only eleven years old, Annie convinces him to wait to meet his new ""protegee"" until the night of the concert. As Susan rehearses, Annie and her men work hard, although Annie continues to feel hurt by Terry's rejection. One day, after learning that Severn has given Annie an important assignment, Bullwinkle empties her fuel tanks and disables her radio so that he can steal the job. The crew mistakenly believes that Terry is responsible for the sabotage, and Johnny challenges Terry to a fistfight. Terry beats Johnny until he sees Johnny's leg brace, and after he allows the disabled man to win the altercation, Terry invites the other crewmen to get their licks in. Having won the men's respect, Terry then forces Bullwinkle to admit that he committed the sabotage. Annie's faith in Terry is restored, but he disappears before she can reconcile with him. He leaves behind a note apologizing for his behavior and promising to return someday. Although she misses Terry, Annie gladly attends Susan's debut, during which the amazed Pucci is so impressed with her talent that he forgets the trick played upon him by Annie. After the concert, Annie and her crew return to the waterfront, where they immediately help battle a fire started by a welder. Terry has also returned and pitches in to help, as does Bullwinkle. As Annie's tug tows a blazing oil tanker away from the wharf, Johnny sacrifices his life to save Terry, who was attempting to free the tanker from Annie's boat. Afterward, Annie wants to quit, but Severn assures her that her bravery and that of her men has won them a lucrative contract. Terry, who has just married Marion, also asks Annie to stay, and finally embraces her and calls her ""Mom."" Susan is set on the road to stardom with a contract with the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra, and Annie playfully reconciles with Bullwinkle, who dives into the water rather than accept a kiss from her.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0037577/?ref_=sr_i_473,"['George Callahan', 'Norman Reilly Raine']",['Phil Rosen'],"['Jane Darwell', 'Edgar Kennedy', 'Charles Gordon', 'Mantan Moreland', 'Pamela Blake', 'Hardie Albright', 'H.B.

After Tex and Steve ride their separate trails to Antelope Valley, Cannonball, a third scout, decides to follow them. Along the trail, Steve witnesses the holdup of a wagon driven by Sally Boylston, the niece of missing rancher Andrew Boylston. After the robber steals a legal document belonging to Sally, Steve overtakes him and escorts him to town, arriving just after Sally and her passenger, banker Henry Emerson, arrive. Jim Norton, the foreman of the Boylston ranch, who is secretly in league with the rustlers, accuses Steve of being one of the bandits. The document in Steve's possession is used to convict him, and he is sentenced to be hanged. Preparations for Steve's execution are underway when Tex and Canonball ride into town and rescue him. Later, disguising himself as The Durango Kid, a masked fighter for justice, Steve visits Sally at her ranch, and she tells him that Norton, despite the threat of the rustlers, has decided to drive a herd of cattle to an isolated Army outpost. Suspecting a setup, Steve, Tex and Cannonball disrupt the ensuing cattle raid and follow the rustlers to their hideout. There, they discover that Boylston is being held hostage, and after a shootout in which the rancher is wounded, they free him and take him to his ranch. While Sally and Tex take Boylston to the doctor in town, Steve and Cannonball decoy the bandits. Just as Steve shoots one of the rustlers, the sheriff and his posse appear. The outlaws accuse Steve and Cannonball of being rustlers, but Steve claims that Boylston can prove his innocence. The sheriff then accompanies them all to town, but when Boylston and the others fail to arrive, he jails Steve and Cannonball. After breaking out of the cell, Steve, suspecting that Norton and his henchmen are holding Boylston, Tex and Sally prisoner, dons his Durango Kid disguise and rides to the Boylston ranch to search for evidence to incriminate Norton. Upon finding a damning bank book in Norton's name, Steve confronts him with the evidence and threatens to turn him over to the authorities unless Norton gives him half of his ill-gotten gains.

The sentence devastates Ten Spot's girlfriend ""Jenny the Juke,"" who tells the judge that her boyfriend has reformed; he stole the car to take her to the hospital when she suffered from appendicitis. The judge refuses to accept Jenny's arguments, and she accuses him of lacking feeling and understanding. Later, Avery and his wife Penelope leave for a vacation in Hot Springs, but their plans go awry when their chauffeur George Baxter quits. Stranded halfway between their home and Hot Springs, Penelope takes over the driving and crashes the car. A thunderstorm then forces the couple to take refuge at the Jungle Club inn, which, unknown to the Websters, is a front for jailed gangster Aloysius ""Cookie"" Blaine's operation. The Websters sense danger and decide to leave, but are prevented from doing so by Cookie's henchmen. Later, the gangsters read about their pal Ten Spot's sentence and vow to take revenge on the judge who sentenced him, unaware that Avery was that judge. While the Websters sleep at the inn, the hoodlums steal Avery's briefcase, in which they discover a floor plan of a bank. Although the plan is evidence for a case on which Avery is working, it leads the gangsters to conclude that Avery is actually a fellow thief with a lot ""on the ball."" Two of the gangsters, Lola La Forest and Montana, decide to leave Cookie and work for Avery, and ask to be included in his bank heist. Realizing that he has been mistaken for a thief, the judge decides to stay at the Jungle Club long enough to show the gangsters the way to honest living. With the cooperation of the police, Avery succeeds in gaining the release of Cookie from jail, and, as a result, the gangsters put their trust in him. Convinced that Lola and Montana intend to reform after one last ""job,"" Avery leads the gangsters to his home and allows them to rob it. Back at the Jungle Club, Jenny, who is one of Cookie's followers, recognizes Avery as the judge who put her boyfriend behind bars. The gangsters hold a mock trial and charge Avery with double-crossing them and setting them up for arrest. Avery, however, proves that he involved none of them in a single illegal act, and that he took a chance on them to prove that crime does not pay. After the gangsters forgive Avery, he confesses to Jenny that he was too harsh on Ten Spot, and promises to reopen his case. The entire gang reforms, and after Avery puts up the money for them to open the Jungle Club as a legitimate nightclub, they all celebrate with a big party.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0038118/?ref_=sr_i_600,"['Marcel Arnac', 'Bradford Ropes']",['Alexander Esway'],"['Edward Everett Horton', 'Gladys George', 'Ruth Terry', 'Robert Livingston', 'Jack La Rue', 'Lola Lane', 'Isabel Jewell', 'Frank Jenks', 'Paul Hurst', 'Harry Barris']",,,,,"July 9, 1945",['United States'],"['Republic Studios, Hollywood, Los Angeles, California, USA (Studio)']",['Republic Pictures (I)'],,"['Comedy', 'Crime']",['English']
