Seeing Penelope kissing Geoffry, Penelope's relatives assume they are back together and announce their engagement.

Kindell, convinced he has been visited by a spirit to warn him about impending doom, runs for his doctor, after which Gabby steals his tickets to that night's football game and sneaks out. At the football game, Gabby grabs the microphone from the KPQ radio station announcer and launches into an impromptu play-by-play commentary. His rapid-fire patter is heard by KPQ's president, H. I.

Captain Tugboat Annie,1945,1h 10m,Approved,6.3,26,,"On the day that the U.S. government relaxes wartime restrictions and allows tugboats to return to work, Alec Severn, the proprietor of Secoma Towing & Salvage, desperately searches for Tugboat Annie Brennan, the captain of his fleet. Wanting to replace Annie, his longtime nemesis, rival captain Bullwinkle gives Severn an incorrect address for Annie. The indomitable Annie nonetheless reaches Severn's office just in time and signs a new contract with him. Annie then hires her crew, all of whom are veterans: Pinto and Shiftless, who worked with Annie before the war; a newcomer named Missouri Jones; and Johnny Webb, who was injured while saving the lives of the other three men in combat. Soon after Annie begins work with her crew, they are interrupted by the appearance of Susan Henley, an orphan whose father used to work for Severn. Susan, a violin prodigy, wishes to stay with Annie, who wants to adopt her, but Severn convinces Annie that Susan would be better off living with his family. Annie still pines for a child, however, so Severn arranges with Judge Abbott for her to adopt one of the juvenile delinquent boys under his jurisdiction. On the day of her ""son's"" arrival, Annie is dismayed that the ""boy"" sent to her is Terry Jordan, a young veteran on probation for beating the man who swindled Terry's now-deceased mother while he was fighting overseas. The hostile Terry rejects Annie's friendly advances, and his treatment of Annie does not endear him to her crew either. Later, Annie and Marion Graves, Abbott's secretary, arrange for Susan to make her debut with famed conductor Alfred Puccini, a womanizer whom Annie knew when he was the ordinary Al Pucci. In order to prevent Pucci from discovering that Susan is only eleven years old, Annie convinces him to wait to meet his new ""protegee"" until the night of the concert. As Susan rehearses, Annie and her men work hard, although Annie continues to feel hurt by Terry's rejection. One day, after learning that Severn has given Annie an important assignment, Bullwinkle empties her fuel tanks and disables her radio so that he can steal the job. The crew mistakenly believes that Terry is responsible for the sabotage, and Johnny challenges Terry to a fistfight. Terry beats Johnny until he sees Johnny's leg brace, and after he allows the disabled man to win the altercation, Terry invites the other crewmen to get their licks in. Having won the men's respect, Terry then forces Bullwinkle to admit that he committed the sabotage. Annie's faith in Terry is restored, but he disappears before she can reconcile with him. He leaves behind a note apologizing for his behavior and promising to return someday. Although she misses Terry, Annie gladly attends Susan's debut, during which the amazed Pucci is so impressed with her talent that he forgets the trick played upon him by Annie. After the concert, Annie and her crew return to the waterfront, where they immediately help battle a fire started by a welder. Terry has also returned and pitches in to help, as does Bullwinkle. As Annie's tug tows a blazing oil tanker away from the wharf, Johnny sacrifices his life to save Terry, who was attempting to free the tanker from Annie's boat. Afterward, Annie wants to quit, but Severn assures her that her bravery and that of her men has won them a lucrative contract. Terry, who has just married Marion, also asks Annie to stay, and finally embraces her and calls her ""Mom."" Susan is set on the road to stardom with a contract with the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra, and Annie playfully reconciles with Bullwinkle, who dives into the water rather than accept a kiss from her.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0037577/?ref_=sr_i_473

The sentence devastates Ten Spot's girlfriend ""Jenny the Juke,"" who tells the judge that her boyfriend has reformed; he stole the car to take her to the hospital when she suffered from appendicitis. The judge refuses to accept Jenny's arguments, and she accuses him of lacking feeling and understanding. Later, Avery and his wife Penelope leave for a vacation in Hot Springs, but their plans go awry when their chauffeur George Baxter quits. Stranded halfway between their home and Hot Springs, Penelope takes over the driving and crashes the car. A thunderstorm then forces the couple to take refuge at the Jungle Club inn, which, unknown to the Websters, is a front for jailed gangster Aloysius ""Cookie"" Blaine's operation. The Websters sense danger and decide to leave, but are prevented from doing so by Cookie's henchmen. Later, the gangsters read about their pal Ten Spot's sentence and vow to take revenge on the judge who sentenced him, unaware that Avery was that judge. While the Websters sleep at the inn, the hoodlums steal Avery's briefcase, in which they discover a floor plan of a bank. Although the plan is evidence for a case on which Avery is working, it leads the gangsters to conclude that Avery is actually a fellow thief with a lot ""on the ball."" Two of the gangsters, Lola La Forest and Montana, decide to leave Cookie and work for Avery, and ask to be included in his bank heist. Realizing that he has been mistaken for a thief, the judge decides to stay at the Jungle Club long enough to show the gangsters the way to honest living. With the cooperation of the police, Avery succeeds in gaining the release of Cookie from jail, and, as a result, the gangsters put their trust in him. Convinced that Lola and Montana intend to reform after one last ""job,"" Avery leads the gangsters to his home and allows them to rob it. Back at the Jungle Club, Jenny, who is one of Cookie's followers, recognizes Avery as the judge who put her boyfriend behind bars. The gangsters hold a mock trial and charge Avery with double-crossing them and setting them up for arrest. Avery, however, proves that he involved none of them in a single illegal act, and that he took a chance on them to prove that crime does not pay. After the gangsters forgive Avery, he confesses to Jenny that he was too harsh on Ten Spot, and promises to reopen his case. The entire gang reforms, and after Avery puts up the money for them to open the Jungle Club as a legitimate nightclub, they all celebrate with a big party.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0038118/?ref_=sr_i_600
