While nouveau riche, uncouth Hortense courts the attention, the excitement and the European bachelors clamoring after her, Daisy is more reclusive, wanting to stay out of the party scene and limelight by hiding aboard her yacht. Daisy desperately wants to marry for love, and not marry because it makes good print (and thus sell more face cream for her father), especially as she knows those European men are only after her money. So Daisy offers a proposition to Johnny Jones, a Florida Star newspaper reporter she befriends: marry her out of convenience. What she wants is that marriage license to dissuade all those European suitors while she quietly searches for that true love, a man with simple, American values. In turn, she knows that Johnny doesn't want her money or a society life, all he wanting is a quiet place to write his novel and a small stipend equal to his meager newspaper wage just to live on his own terms. In entering into this agreement, Daisy doesn't count on her father's PR man Jorgenson trying to make Johnny into a society man he doesn't want to be. Daisy is also hiding two secrets from Johnny, one of those secrets being that she has found the man she truly loves: him.

In order to enter his filly ""Black Mamba"" in the Kentucky Derby, Towny sells his polo horses. At Churchill Downs, Towny meets bankrupt Kentucky colonel Barnaby and his gold digging daughter Sally. During the Derby, Black Mamba's jockey falls off the horse and Towny loses. After the race, creditors try to repossess Black Mamba, but her devoted trainer, Valerie ""Boots"" O'Connell, steals her and places her on the private train car of Towny's dyspeptic, rich uncle Morton Middleton. On the train, Sally and Towny kiss. Back in Long Island, at Towny's Greenhill Manor, they marry, and Boots's heart is broken. On their honeymoon, Sally spends $12,000 on clothes, believing Towny is still a millionaire. When he scolds her for her extravagance, she throws a tantrum and forces him to concede. Boots's father, who managed the Middleton stables for years, then dies, and Towny shortens the honeymoon to return to Boots. Again Sally cries and Towny buys her a Rolls Royce to appease her. When Boots insists on leaving Greenhill Manor, Towny gives her Black Mamba to prevent creditors from using the filly as collateral against Towny. Towny's valet, Bill, finally tells Sally she's broke, but she is counting on Black Mamba and Uncle Morton's eighty million. Colonel Barnaby then arrives at Greenhill Manor for an indefinite stay. When Sally realizes Towny loves not her, but Boots, she dismisses Towny's staff, including Bill and Boots, and Towny again acquiesces. The sheriff then forecloses on Greenhill Manor, and Boots sells Black Mamba to Uncle Morton in order to help Towny, promising to train the horse for the next Kentucky Derby. Bill gets himself hired as Morton's health advisor and cures Morton's dispositional dyspepsia. When Barnaby and Sally go to Morton for money, Bill bugs their car and Morton overhears them saying they are waiting for him to die. After Morton buys Greenhill Manor and has Barnaby and Towny evicted, Towny becomes determined to get a job. He becomes a famous sports broadcaster and diligently saves his money. In lieu of Towny's success, the Barnabys resurface, but a wiser Towny tricks them into accepting $1,000 for a Reno divorce.

Harrison's aunts inveigle him into traveling to Kansas City to buy the slab, but the granite salesman has gone out of business. Upon returning home, Harrison, acting on a tip from his drunken sales manager, Sam Smith, buys stock from crooked oilmen Spencer and Gilbert. Harrison hopes Spencer and Gilbert will purchase equipment from his shop for a Gentry oil well, but is unaware they are being investigated for tax evasion. News of Harrison's stock purchase travels quickly around town, and soon most of Gentry's veterans have spent their bonuses on ""S&G"" stock. The well goes up, but after digging 6,000 feet and not hitting oil, Spencer and Gilbert dissolve their company and leave town. The stockholders, including Caroline's father, blame Harrison for their losses, and vote him out of the American Legion and boycott his store. Determined to help his friends, Harrison hires Sam's friend, geologist Cliff Spaulding of Texas, to investigate the dry well. Spaulding discovers ""S&G"" actually drilled only to 950 feet and suspects the property adjacent to the well, Gentry Park, is oil-filled. Harrison then contacts an old army friend who is now a detective, and he and his friends help Harrison blow up ""S&G""'s safe, forcing Spencer and Gilbert to release the Gentry oil lands to him. With S and G's money, Harrison builds a new well and, after his aunts sell him Gentry Park, strikes oil.

Humiliated, but driven to sing, she travels to South America under the assumed name of Maria Delasano, and works in an opera company under the tutelage of Feodor Glinka, who wants her to shun men and save herself for her art. Mary resists the persistent attentions of wealthy young Phil Roberts, who follows the company in hopes of marrying her. Phil's brother David distrusts her lack of interest in Phil, believing it to be a ploy to entrap him for his wealth. After a successful performance, Mary is courted by Uberto Malla, a wealthy patron, and Martan Fontes, director of an opera company in Rio. Malla proposes to Maria and offers her a position in the company in Rio, but she declines. While they are play-acting a scene, Malla is killed, and Mary is suspected as the murderer. She is acquitted, however, and travels with her agents Melba York and Rudy Hochstetter to Paris, with the hopeful Phil in tow. The negative publicity surrounding the murder has reduced Mary to performing in a nightclub as ""Malevo, Siren of Song."" Although Mary is adamant in her rejection, Phil persists in pursuing her until he is killed while waiting in a car for David. Seeing a connection between the marriage proposals and the murders, David poses as Mary's new suitor to trap the murderer, whom they suspect to be Fontes.

443. The 3 Wise Guys,1936,1h 13m,Approved,7.9,16,,"Riding in his private car on Christmas day, railroad tycoon Hatcher prefers work to celebrating, while his son Joe prefers having a good time. In the coach car, Joe sees pretty Clarabelle Brooks and is sincerely concerned when she faints. A doctor, who is also in the car, helps to revive Clarabelle, says that she is suffering from severe hunger and, with fellow passenger Blackie Swanson, passes the hat for her. Later, Clarabelle, who is secretly working with con-men Doc and Blackie, goes to their compartment to discuss plans to set Joe up for a breach of promise suit. When the train arrives in Los Angeles, Joe continues to see Clarabelle and gets her a job as a model in a swank dress shop. Mr. Hatcher is suspicious and wants Joe to spend time working instead of wining and dining Clarabelle, but Joe is in love and continues to see her. Meanwhile, Blackie starts to get jealous because he suspects that Clarabelle is falling for Joe. When Joe proposes, Clarabelle realizes she is in love and the two elope to Palm Springs. When Blackie finds out where she has gone, he and Doc follow her and, while Joe is out of their room, she tells them that she truly loves Joe and doesn't want him to know about her past. Though Blackie is hurt, he and Doc wish her well. When Joe and Clarabelle go to Hatcher, he is sweet to Clarabelle, but he says that he is cutting them off without a penny. Though Joe is upset, Clarabelle says she doesn't mind because she loves him. After Joe sells his polo ponies to finance their honeymoon, the two change their last name to ""Smith"" to avoid being bothered by reporters, and move to a rundown farm in Pennsylvania. They have difficulty with the farm, though, and Joe is unable to find work elsewhere. One day, the house burns down and they are forced to move into the barn. Their landlord, Mr. Baumgarden, is so delighted that the destroyed house will enable him to collect the insurance that he gets Joe a job in his factory, working under Lawrence Ambersham. Meanwhile, in New York, Doc and Blackie see a magazine article about Pennsylvania businessmen and Doc recognizes Ambersham as a former conman named Anderson. Doc and Blackie then go to Ambersham, and threaten him with exposure unless he gives them $20,000. Ambersham agrees, but, unknown to Doc and Blackie, arranges for Joe to work late that night and take the blame for his planned robbery. While Joe is alone at the office, thieves break in and rob the safe, then kidnap Joe, but when a guard starts to shoot, Joe is dropped from the car. When the police find Joe, they think he is one of the robbers and Ambersham gives false evidence to incriminate him. Three months later, on Christmas Eve, Doc, who has been working as a sidewalk Santa Claus, stops for a drink with Blackie and runs into Yegg, one of the hold-up men. Yegg has been in the hospital the whole time and tells Blackie that he buried the robbery money in a barn back in Pennsylvania. The three men then drive to the barn, where they find a very ill Clarabelle lying alone inside the barn. Doc tells Yegg and Blackie to wait outside while he attends to Clarabelle and then helps her give birth to a baby. Later, Blackie, who still loves her, helps take her to the hospital and tells her not to worry about Joe. He then goes to Mr. Baumgarden, gives him the money and tells him that Joe is innocent. He also reveals that Joe is Hatcher's son. As Doc, Blackie and Yegg leave town, Doc wonders what the name of the town is, not knowing that it is ""Bethlehem."" Next Christmas, the entire Hatcher family is riding in a private train compartment and as Joe happily works, his father and Clarabelle play with the baby.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0028374/?ref_=sr_i_443,"['Damon Runyon', 'Elmer Harris']",['George B.

468. Parole!,1936,1h 7m,Approved,6.7,44,,"In a state penitentiary on New Year's Eve, gangster ""Okay"" Percy Smith knifes fellow inmate Zingo Browning, killing him. The next day, convicted lawyers Russell Whalen and Marty Crawford plead their cases before the Parole Board. Russ is released on parole, while Marty is ordered to remain behind bars until Zingo's murder is solved. Marty is in prison for fixing a jury to save an innocent man, and when Russ is released, he arranges for Russ to work with his old law partner, Jack Driscoll. The twenty-four-year-old Russ was convicted of killing a man in a car accident and is eager to make good, but Driscoll assigns him to Richard K. Mallard, a crooked politician who believes in astrology and is the boss of the city graft machine. Okay, who was let out of prison when Mallard paid a woman to pose as Okay's fainting mother, takes Russ with him when he collects money from the businessmen whom Mallard controls. When Russ sees Okay nearly kill a man for refusing to give up his city contract to Mallard, he saves the man, then quits Mallard's service. Marty's daughter Frances then gets Russ a job with her boss, manufacturer Rex Gavin, who is spearheading an anti-parole campaign in an effort to fight the recent crime wave perpetrated by released convicts. Okay then robs a bank in order to pay Mallard's aide, John Borchard, for securing the release of Russ's friend, Bobby Freeman, from prison so Okay will have a scapegoat when he needs one. After Bobby goes to live with Russ, Marty is released from prison, and when Driscoll visits, Russ rails at him for associating with Mallard. Borchard then tells Gavin he has an ex-convict working for him, and Gavin fires not only Russ and Frances, but five other good workers who also happen to be ex-convicts. When Post Courier reporter Gregory interviews Russ about the Gavin Manufacturing Company dismissals, he reveals all he knows about Mallard's operation to paper chief Earl Bigbee. After headlines implicate Mallard, Driscoll offers Russ his apartment as a hiding place. Okay and Dummy Watts, who had also been in the state prison, then force Bobby to lead them to Russ. At Driscoll's apartment, Bobby and Russ struggle to keep out Okay and Dummy, but the thugs get the door open and shoot and kill Bobby. Marty is wounded trying to escape, and Russ is blamed for the shooting and is jailed after revealing Okay and Dummy's hideout to be a barge. At the barge, the police cuff Dummy and Okay, but Okay jumps into the water and is shot at as he swims away. Joyce Daniels, Mallard's secretary who is in love with Russ, then gives Frances the records needed to incriminate Mallard and free Russ. After she is abducted by Borchard and killed, Frances hands over the evidence to Gavin, who organizes the city leaders and the governor to investigate and try Mallard. Mallard is exposed as a grafter, and Russ is exonerated and meets with the authorities to discuss a revitalization of the state parole system. Mallard is indicted, but flees bench warrant by hiding out in the mortuary of A. R. Patton, where Bobby's body is interred. With Borchard, Mallard tries to escape to Rio de Janiero in Bobby's coffin, but Russ arrives with police inspector Hamilton, who shoots Borchard and arrests Mallard. Governor Slade then appoints the chair to a new parole board, which includes a psychiatrist, and Gavin agrees to help prepare criminals for jobs after parole. Slade pardons Marty and Russ, who can now marry Frances, and Mallard gets fifty years in prison. Russ and Marty look forward to a future as ""Whalen and Crawford, Attorneys at Law.""",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0028087/?ref_=sr_i_468,"['Kubec Glasmon', 'Horace McCoy', 'Joel Sayre']",['Lew Landers'],"['Henry Hunter', 'Ann Shepherd', 'Alan Dinehart', 'Alan Baxter', 'Alan Hale', 'Grant Mitchell', 'Berton Churchill', 'Noah Beery Jr.', 'Bernadene Hayes', 'Wallis Clark']",,,,,"June 14, 1936",['United States'],"['Universal Studios - 100 Universal City Plaza, Universal City, California, USA (Studio)']",['Universal Pictures'],,"['Action', 'Crime', 'Drama', 'Romance']",['English']

The neglected Worthington children seek their parents attention and affection, as they witness the normal family life of next-door neighbor Thomas Scott, John's lawyer and closest friend. When Freddie and Marion bring home an abandoned dog, the two are sent to bed early. With both their parents away for the evening, the two sneak out of bed to play hide and seek. Marion, searching for Freddie, falls down the dumbwaiter and is seriously injured. The two parents rush home, and each blames the other for the child's injury. Edith, claiming that John is neglecting her as well as the children, files for divorce. Following their parents, divorce, Freddie and Marion are split up, with Freddie living with John while Marion leaves with Edith. Years later, John has fulfilled his dream of a great railroad empire, but is faced with two dilemmas: his workers are threatening to strike and Freddie has been thrown out of yet another college. John manages to break his workers' union, but Freddie tells his father that he would rather be disinherited than become a mirror of his father. With the help of his girl friend, blues singer Gale Adams, Freddie gets a job as a singing piano player in a small family restaurant. Meanwhile, Marion has led a similarly rebellious life. After Edith informs her that she is going off on a European vacation, Marion disowns her mother, goes to a wild cocktail party, and impulsively marries Roy Daniels. When Daniels is arrested on their wedding night for jewel theft, Marion is arrested as an accessory and spends one year in prison. Released from prison, Marion is unable to find work and contemplates suicide when she is evicted from her apartment. Her next-door neighbor, Elsie, takes her out to dinner, to the restaurant where Freddie works. When Roy enters the restaurant, Elsie, one of his jilted lovers, re-introduces him to his wife. Marion refuses to have anything to do with Roy, and when the thief tries to get rough with her, Freddie comes to her aid. Later, Marion tries to commit suicide by slipping pills into her drink, but Freddie stops her, and the two discover they are brother and sister. They go back to Marion's apartment, but their happy reunion is interrupted by the reappearance of Roy. When Roy and Freddie fight, a gun goes off and Roy is killed.

In the crowd are Kay Armstrong, an Amalgamated stewardess who is dating Wad Madison, a veteran pilot, and her sister Penny. Although the playboy Len prefers Kay, he goes out with Penny, who eventually follows him to New York on the pretext of furthering her show business career. While Kay grows frustrated by Wad's fanatical dedication to flying, Penny is dismayed by Len's heavy drinking. In spite of Penny's warnings, Len violates an aviation rule that stipulates that pilots should not fly within twenty-four hours of imbibing alcohol and makes a flight after a night of drinking. During the trip, Len experiences mechanical trouble but bails out just before the airplane crashes. His co-pilot, however, is killed. After bribing a bartender, Len is cleared of suspicion in the crash but is rejected by Penny. Broke, Len returns to Portland to fly for his father, who convinces Wad to abandon his plans to marry Kay and tutor Len. Oblivious to Wad, Len begins to romance Kay, who is impressed by the younger pilot's easy charm. When a jealous Wad finds Len drunk at Kay's apartment, he criticizes Kay for encouraging Len's bad habits. Resentful of Wad's possessiveness, Kay snubs him and, during a flying lesson, rejects his marriage proposal. Kay then writes to Penny, asking her advice about marrying Len, unaware of her sister's previous involvement with him. Concerned, Penny flies to Portland and meets secretly with Len to ask him to end his affair with Kay or have his crimes exposed. When he refuses to comply, Penny starts to telephone Kay, but is slugged by Len and fractures her skull on his mantle-piece. Leaving Penny unconscious, Len rushes to his next flight to Salt Lake City and asks Kay to marry him as soon as they land. By the time they reach Salt Lake City, however, Kay receives word that Penny is in the hospital and demands that they take Wad's flight back to Portland. When the airplane experiences engine trouble, Wad prepares to make an emergency landing, but Len locks him out of the cockpit and flies the craft to Portland. Accused publicly by Len of cowardice, Wad punches his rival and is fired by Kendrick. Wad then visits Penny, who is recuperating from surgery, and learns the truth about Len. Terrified, Wad dashes to the airport, where he hears that Len and Penny's flight to Salt Lake City has been trapped in a blizzard for hours. Eventually Wad connects with Len via radio and orders him to land, but Len, who has knocked out his co-pilot, chooses to jump rather than face a possible crash. After Len's parachute fails to open, Kay takes over the controls and, by following Wad's instructions, makes a safe emergency landing.

518. I Was a Captive of Nazi Germany,1936,1h 12m,,,,,"The history of Germany from 1924 through Hitler's rise in power is described through newsreel footage. Freelance press representative Isobel Lillian Steele travels to Germany to work as a translator/journalist for the English language magazine Germany and You . Thinking a story on the German film industry would be interesting, she becomes acquainted with Herr Luger, the Nazi representative in charge of motion picture employment. Through him she becomes friendly with German actress Catherine Stoloff and eventually Baron Yurick Von Sosnowski, a modern-day Casanova whose parties are the talk of Berlin. While an overload of work on 28 Feb 1934 causes Isobel to miss one of the wealthy nobleman's soirees, the secret police arrest the baron on charges of espionage and his guests are detained, some for weeks, for questioning. Unaware of the imprisonments because the police feign ignorance, Isobel searches for Catherine, which arouses police suspicion that she is a collaborator. Even after Catherine is released a month later, she reveals nothing to Isobel, for the actress, like the other detainees, have been sworn to an oath of silence, which if violated would mean three years imprisonment. On 3 May, the People's Court is formed in Germany. It issues new edicts concerning foreign nationals and anti-Hitlerite activities. Film producer Henry Reicher, a communist sympathizer, contacts Isobel about writing a screenplay for his film Social Espionage which would depict the arrest of the baron and his guests by the secret police. Unaware of his propagandist motives, Isobel begins writing the script with Baroness Von Elmendorff, another of the baron's acquaintances. Although they plan to change the names of the characters in their final draft, the first version of the script contains the real names of the people involved. By 10 August, after President Von Hindenburg has died, removing the last obstacle to Hitler's control, Isobel's script is completed. Two secret policemen, having infiltrated Reicher's company as his secretaries, arrest Reicher and Isobel. Sent to Alexanderplatz, she is charged with espionage when confronted with her first draft. Other charges follow, including treason and associating with communists. Detained as a political espionage prisoner, she is taken to a women's prison. Only slowly does she acclimate to the harsh conditions and bad food. When finally allowed to receive the American Consul as a visitor, she is forbidden to discuss details of her case. Isobel's mother, on the eve of a trip to the United States to seek help for her daughter, is allowed a short visit, but is told not to discuss Isobel's imprisonment. After a constant barrage of distorted accusations by the police, on 11 Sep Isobel is suddenly transferred to Moabit prison, where the Sosnowski women victims have been retained. Her personal belongings confiscated, Isobel finds comfort in a small yarn doll, named Malvina after the first initials of her friends, which becomes her ""fetish of hope"" in a lonely existence. Denied the simplest pleasures, her condition worsens. Mrs. Steele, having arrived in Boise, Idaho, to recruit the assistance of her son, contacts Senator William E. Borah in Washington, D.C., whose involvement in the matter at year's end forces Isobel's case to be ""temporarily closed,"" allowing for her deportation and freedom. Clutching her doll, she sails for New York. As her ship enters New York Harbor, she proudly smiles as the Statue of Liberty rises in the background.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0137824/?ref_=sr_i_518,['Isobel Lillian Steele'],['Alfred T.

556. The Speed Reporter,1936,55m,Approved,5.3,63,,"After a night of gangster terrorism in a large metropolitan city, the police haul in some of the perpetrators. The Evening Gazette runs the headline that financier Roger Renfrew will head the City Reform League in a fight to clean up city politics. The article states that a reign of unchecked gangster terrorism has shaken the city administration to its foundations and caused the resignation of the chief of police. The Gazette editor, Madison, claims he played no small part in getting Renfrew appointed. Madison is actually being controlled by crime boss Brad Franklin, who also gives orders to the timid Renfrew. With Renfrew in office, Franklin is confident that the city is now completely in his control, and he doles out gambling, slot machine and lottery rackets to his henchmen. Madison and Franklin are conspiring to eliminate The Daily Press , the Gazette 's rival newspaper, which is run by honest newsman John Parker. The Press missed the Renfrew story because Franklin's men had threatened spineless city editor Stanley, and he had taken fearless, animated cub reporter Dick Laurence off the city hall beat. When Parker reads the Gazette 's story, he is outraged, and chastises Stanley, who blames Dick. After Dick returns to the newsroom with fake handcuffs and a water pistol and uses them on Stanley, he is fired. When Parker asks Dick why he did not cover the story, he tells him that racketeers are running the reform league and Madison is in league with them. Anxious to prove that the press cannot be manipulated, Parker assigns Dick the reform league story and promises him a raise and a bonus if he succeeds. Dick eagerly promises to get Renfrew's resignation. Stanley calls Renfrew to clear himself from any association with the Press 's reporting. Dick's girl friend, May, who also works for the Press , listens to Stanley's call from an adjoining phone booth and upbraids him for being a coward. When Dick visits Renfrew's office, two of Franklin's men accost him, but he bests them, handcuffs them with his fake cuffs, and takes their photograph. May has followed with a policeman, and when Renfrew denies any connection with the hoods, they announce that Franklin is behind him. Fearing retaliation from Franklin for failing to back his men, Renfrew calls Madison, who advises him to meet Franklin's henchman, Edwards, who will lead Renfrew to Franklin's secret apartment. Dick listens in on the telephone conversation and tails Renfrew by jumping through the window into a truck, and taking the place of Frank, Renfrew's chauffeur. After driving Renfrew and Edwards to Franklin's apartment, Dick tricks the porter into divulging the secret number of Franklin's room. As Franklin introduces the timid Renfrew to the girls at his gin party, Dick tells a woman in the apartment above Franklin's that he is a telephone repairman and sneaks out on a ledge to take photographs of the illicit gathering. Renfrew notices the reporter at the window, but Edwards and his men fail to capture Dick. Returning to the newsroom, Dick develops a photograph of Franklin and Renfrew seated on a coach with two women and shows them to Parker. Parker recognizes Franklin as Chuck Ballard, Public Enemy #2. Edwards and his hoods hold up the office and take the photo and negatives, unaware that Dick had already made extra prints. Swinging out the window by a rope, Dick jumps onto the back of the gangster's car as it pulls away. At Franklin's headquarters, Dick is captured, but he escapes when they bind him with his own trick handcuffs. Renfrew receives a copy of the photo from Dick, who has demanded his resignation to prevent its publication, and he telephones to concede. Stanley takes the call and goes to Renfrew's office, hoping to upstage Dick. Renfrew announces his resignation to Madison, who calls Franklin, and as Renfrew writes out his resignation for Stanley, all convene at Renfrew's office. By having his men ruffle Stanley, Franklin hopes to intimidate Renfrew into not resigning. Dick, who has imprisoned two of the gangsters in the back of a van, arrives and knocks out Franklin's chauffeur. He then enters the office and pulls a gun on the group, ordering Stanley to disarm them. When he shows the group the photograph, Madison and Renfrew are astonished to learn that they have been cooperating with Chuck Ballard. Dick telephones Parker with the scoop that he has captured Ballard, and Parker hands the phone to May for dictation. Assured of a bonus from Parker, Dick asks May to get a marriage license with him that afternoon, but gives himself away when he accidentally squirts his water pistol. A fistfight ensues, which Dick wins single-handedly. After the police arrive, Parker and May come to the scene. When Dick proposes to May, Parker offers to pay for their honeymoon.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0030777/?ref_=sr_i_556,"['Harry S. Webb', 'Rose Gordon']",['Bernard B.

Gene had been sent to St.John's to investigate a series of accidents which threatened to close down the lumber mill.Undercover, Alan asks for a job at the mill and hears of an accident which has killed four men. He suspects Barstow (J.P. McGowan), the camp blacksmith, who welded the chain that broke and sent the men to their death. Alan convinces Barstow that he is a fugitive from justice, and would do anything for a job. Barstow gives Alan a Mountie's uniform and tells him he is to pose as a Mountie (good plan) sent to investigate the accident.

Kelly and Edith Fellows the only American citizens in the credited cast. When her parents are drowned at sea, ""Princess"" Judy is adopted by a soft-hearted old sea captain, Captain Zack, and brought to live on his tugboat. Hard times come to the Captain because his boat is unable to compete with the faster and more modern tugboats of the Darling Navigation Company owned by Zack's old rival and enemy, Captain Darling. More misery follows when Judy breaks a leg and Zack can't pay her hospital bill. He borrows the needed money from Darling but is forced to agree to give up both his boat and docking space if he can't meet the note. Then welfare workers come along and decide Judy isn't receiving proper treatment or schooling living aboard the tugboat and they haul her off to an orphanage. No eyebrows are raised reference the agency that allowed a 60-year-old geezer to adopt a non-related 13-year-old girl and put her on a boat with three men.
