In the crowd are Kay Armstrong, an Amalgamated stewardess who is dating Wad Madison, a veteran pilot, and her sister Penny. Although the playboy Len prefers Kay, he goes out with Penny, who eventually follows him to New York on the pretext of furthering her show business career. While Kay grows frustrated by Wad's fanatical dedication to flying, Penny is dismayed by Len's heavy drinking. In spite of Penny's warnings, Len violates an aviation rule that stipulates that pilots should not fly within twenty-four hours of imbibing alcohol and makes a flight after a night of drinking. During the trip, Len experiences mechanical trouble but bails out just before the airplane crashes. His co-pilot, however, is killed. After bribing a bartender, Len is cleared of suspicion in the crash but is rejected by Penny. Broke, Len returns to Portland to fly for his father, who convinces Wad to abandon his plans to marry Kay and tutor Len. Oblivious to Wad, Len begins to romance Kay, who is impressed by the younger pilot's easy charm. When a jealous Wad finds Len drunk at Kay's apartment, he criticizes Kay for encouraging Len's bad habits. Resentful of Wad's possessiveness, Kay snubs him and, during a flying lesson, rejects his marriage proposal. Kay then writes to Penny, asking her advice about marrying Len, unaware of her sister's previous involvement with him. Concerned, Penny flies to Portland and meets secretly with Len to ask him to end his affair with Kay or have his crimes exposed. When he refuses to comply, Penny starts to telephone Kay, but is slugged by Len and fractures her skull on his mantle-piece. Leaving Penny unconscious, Len rushes to his next flight to Salt Lake City and asks Kay to marry him as soon as they land. By the time they reach Salt Lake City, however, Kay receives word that Penny is in the hospital and demands that they take Wad's flight back to Portland.

Terrified, Wad dashes to the airport, where he hears that Len and Penny's flight to Salt Lake City has been trapped in a blizzard for hours.

518. I Was a Captive of Nazi Germany,1936,1h 12m,,,,,"The history of Germany from 1924 through Hitler's rise in power is described through newsreel footage. Freelance press representative Isobel Lillian Steele travels to Germany to work as a translator/journalist for the English language magazine Germany and You . Thinking a story on the German film industry would be interesting, she becomes acquainted with Herr Luger, the Nazi representative in charge of motion picture employment. Through him she becomes friendly with German actress Catherine Stoloff and eventually Baron Yurick Von Sosnowski, a modern-day Casanova whose parties are the talk of Berlin. While an overload of work on 28 Feb 1934 causes Isobel to miss one of the wealthy nobleman's soirees, the secret police arrest the baron on charges of espionage and his guests are detained, some for weeks, for questioning. Unaware of the imprisonments because the police feign ignorance, Isobel searches for Catherine, which arouses police suspicion that she is a collaborator. Even after Catherine is released a month later, she reveals nothing to Isobel, for the actress, like the other detainees, have been sworn to an oath of silence, which if violated would mean three years imprisonment. On 3 May, the People's Court is formed in Germany. It issues new edicts concerning foreign nationals and anti-Hitlerite activities. Film producer Henry Reicher, a communist sympathizer, contacts Isobel about writing a screenplay for his film Social Espionage which would depict the arrest of the baron and his guests by the secret police. Unaware of his propagandist motives, Isobel begins writing the script with Baroness Von Elmendorff, another of the baron's acquaintances. Although they plan to change the names of the characters in their final draft, the first version of the script contains the real names of the people involved. By 10 August, after President Von Hindenburg has died, removing the last obstacle to Hitler's control, Isobel's script is completed. Two secret policemen, having infiltrated Reicher's company as his secretaries, arrest Reicher and Isobel. Sent to Alexanderplatz, she is charged with espionage when confronted with her first draft. Other charges follow, including treason and associating with communists. Detained as a political espionage prisoner, she is taken to a women's prison. Only slowly does she acclimate to the harsh conditions and bad food. When finally allowed to receive the American Consul as a visitor, she is forbidden to discuss details of her case. Isobel's mother, on the eve of a trip to the United States to seek help for her daughter, is allowed a short visit, but is told not to discuss Isobel's imprisonment. After a constant barrage of distorted accusations by the police, on 11 Sep Isobel is suddenly transferred to Moabit prison, where the Sosnowski women victims have been retained. Her personal belongings confiscated, Isobel finds comfort in a small yarn doll, named Malvina after the first initials of her friends, which becomes her ""fetish of hope"" in a lonely existence. Denied the simplest pleasures, her condition worsens. Mrs. Steele, having arrived in Boise, Idaho, to recruit the assistance of her son, contacts Senator William E. Borah in Washington, D.C., whose involvement in the matter at year's end forces Isobel's case to be ""temporarily closed,"" allowing for her deportation and freedom. Clutching her doll, she sails for New York. As her ship enters New York Harbor, she proudly smiles as the Statue of Liberty rises in the background.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0137824/?ref_=sr_i_518

556. The Speed Reporter,1936,55m,Approved,5.3,63,,"After a night of gangster terrorism in a large metropolitan city, the police haul in some of the perpetrators. The Evening Gazette runs the headline that financier Roger Renfrew will head the City Reform League in a fight to clean up city politics. The article states that a reign of unchecked gangster terrorism has shaken the city administration to its foundations and caused the resignation of the chief of police. The Gazette editor, Madison, claims he played no small part in getting Renfrew appointed. Madison is actually being controlled by crime boss Brad Franklin, who also gives orders to the timid Renfrew. With Renfrew in office, Franklin is confident that the city is now completely in his control, and he doles out gambling, slot machine and lottery rackets to his henchmen. Madison and Franklin are conspiring to eliminate The Daily Press , the Gazette 's rival newspaper, which is run by honest newsman John Parker. The Press missed the Renfrew story because Franklin's men had threatened spineless city editor Stanley, and he had taken fearless, animated cub reporter Dick Laurence off the city hall beat. When Parker reads the Gazette 's story, he is outraged, and chastises Stanley, who blames Dick. After Dick returns to the newsroom with fake handcuffs and a water pistol and uses them on Stanley, he is fired. When Parker asks Dick why he did not cover the story, he tells him that racketeers are running the reform league and Madison is in league with them. Anxious to prove that the press cannot be manipulated, Parker assigns Dick the reform league story and promises him a raise and a bonus if he succeeds. Dick eagerly promises to get Renfrew's resignation. Stanley calls Renfrew to clear himself from any association with the Press 's reporting. Dick's girl friend, May, who also works for the Press , listens to Stanley's call from an adjoining phone booth and upbraids him for being a coward. When Dick visits Renfrew's office, two of Franklin's men accost him, but he bests them, handcuffs them with his fake cuffs, and takes their photograph. May has followed with a policeman, and when Renfrew denies any connection with the hoods, they announce that Franklin is behind him. Fearing retaliation from Franklin for failing to back his men, Renfrew calls Madison, who advises him to meet Franklin's henchman, Edwards, who will lead Renfrew to Franklin's secret apartment. Dick listens in on the telephone conversation and tails Renfrew by jumping through the window into a truck, and taking the place of Frank, Renfrew's chauffeur. After driving Renfrew and Edwards to Franklin's apartment, Dick tricks the porter into divulging the secret number of Franklin's room. As Franklin introduces the timid Renfrew to the girls at his gin party, Dick tells a woman in the apartment above Franklin's that he is a telephone repairman and sneaks out on a ledge to take photographs of the illicit gathering. Renfrew notices the reporter at the window, but Edwards and his men fail to capture Dick. Returning to the newsroom, Dick develops a photograph of Franklin and Renfrew seated on a coach with two women and shows them to Parker. Parker recognizes Franklin as Chuck Ballard, Public Enemy #2. Edwards and his hoods hold up the office and take the photo and negatives, unaware that Dick had already made extra prints. Swinging out the window by a rope, Dick jumps onto the back of the gangster's car as it pulls away. At Franklin's headquarters, Dick is captured, but he escapes when they bind him with his own trick handcuffs. Renfrew receives a copy of the photo from Dick, who has demanded his resignation to prevent its publication, and he telephones to concede. Stanley takes the call and goes to Renfrew's office, hoping to upstage Dick. Renfrew announces his resignation to Madison, who calls Franklin, and as Renfrew writes out his resignation for Stanley, all convene at Renfrew's office. By having his men ruffle Stanley, Franklin hopes to intimidate Renfrew into not resigning. Dick, who has imprisoned two of the gangsters in the back of a van, arrives and knocks out Franklin's chauffeur. He then enters the office and pulls a gun on the group, ordering Stanley to disarm them. When he shows the group the photograph, Madison and Renfrew are astonished to learn that they have been cooperating with Chuck Ballard. Dick telephones Parker with the scoop that he has captured Ballard, and Parker hands the phone to May for dictation. Assured of a bonus from Parker, Dick asks May to get a marriage license with him that afternoon, but gives himself away when he accidentally squirts his water pistol. A fistfight ensues, which Dick wins single-handedly. After the police arrive, Parker and May come to the scene.

560. Secret Patrol,1936,1h,Approved,5.2,43,,"One of the two dozen or more Canadian-produced (usually by Kenneth J. Bishop) films distributed by Columbia circa 1935-39 in order to comply with (and circumvent) the British-Quota Law that basically required a large percentage of the cast and crew of a small percentage of the total films distributed by American film companies to the UK had to be comprised of British subjects and shot on British or Dominion soil.Distributing the Bishop-Canadian made films was cheaper for Columbia than building and maintaining a studio in London.Since Charles Starrett and stunt man Ted Mapes were about the only people connected to this film that currently or in the past weren't subjects of HRM, this film more than qualified.In this one, RCMP Alan Barclay (Charles Starrett)) is sent to investigate the presumed murder of his friend and fellow RCMPoliceman Gene (Henry Mollison)) when Gene's horse is found riderless or, in the words of French-born western director George Archainbaud, ""empty."" Gene had been sent to St.John's to investigate a series of accidents which threatened to close down the lumber mill.Undercover, Alan asks for a job at the mill and hears of an accident which has killed four men. He suspects Barstow (J.P. McGowan), the camp blacksmith, who welded the chain that broke and sent the men to their death. Alan convinces Barstow that he is a fugitive from justice, and would do anything for a job. Barstow gives Alan a Mountie's uniform and tells him he is to pose as a Mountie (good plan) sent to investigate the accident. Ordinarily, at this point, the jig would be up but Ann (Finis Barton)), who knows both Alan and Gene shows up and complications arise.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0028232/?ref_=sr_i_560

The show's title in the program is ""Three Cheers For Love; a review with music, staged by Sharon Dormant.""

Kelly and Edith Fellows the only American citizens in the credited cast. When her parents are drowned at sea, ""Princess"" Judy is adopted by a soft-hearted old sea captain, Captain Zack, and brought to live on his tugboat. Hard times come to the Captain because his boat is unable to compete with the faster and more modern tugboats of the Darling Navigation Company owned by Zack's old rival and enemy, Captain Darling. More misery follows when Judy breaks a leg and Zack can't pay her hospital bill. He borrows the needed money from Darling but is forced to agree to give up both his boat and docking space if he can't meet the note. Then welfare workers come along and decide Judy isn't receiving proper treatment or schooling living aboard the tugboat and they haul her off to an orphanage. No eyebrows are raised reference the agency that allowed a 60-year-old geezer to adopt a non-related 13-year-old girl and put her on a boat with three men. The primary difference between this story and ""Captain January"" is Shirley Temple was many years younger than Edith Fellows, and Guy Kibbee's lighthouse didn't float.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0028421/?ref_=sr_i_600
