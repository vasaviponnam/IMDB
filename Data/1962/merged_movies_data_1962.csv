Babu becomes lonely and homesick especially when he sees his classmates getting letters from their parents and when they come to meet them. Babu is made to believe by the old servant that his mother is in 'vaikuntam' (heaven). Babu sends letters to his mother addressed as ""Mother, Vaikuntam"". The letters are entrusted to the gardener Gopalan Nair (Muthukulam Raghavan Pillai) to be mailed. Gopalan Nair's daughter Sarala (Ambika Sukumaran) happens to see the letters. She takes pity on the child and replies to the letters as if sent by his mother whom he believes is in heaven. Through these letters, Sarala and Babu become close to each other. Once, Babu gets injured while playing. Sarala who meets the child for the first time nurses him until his wounds are healed. Babu believes that Sarala is his mother who has come from the heaven to nurse him and Sarala does not correct him. Mohan returns. He marries Sarala so that Babu may not lose her. Sarala gives birth to Indira (Baby Vinodini). She dotes on both as her own children. Gopalan Nair does not approve of his daughter's fondness for Babu. He reveals the truth to the boy. Babu is upset; he begins to feel that Sarala does not care for him. He runs away from home with Indira. Mohan and Sarala, with the help of the police, begin their search for the children.

Willy (trumpet) and his friend Franz (slide trombone), are musicians with the Bambus (bamboo) Band. They are still planning to take their vacation trip to the south, to Trieste, Italy, and on to Yugoslavia, only now they will use their own minibus. Willy tells Franz, ""under one condition: no women."" Later, in the Bambus Bar, management holds a singing talent competition. Barbi Lothar wins 1st prize, Till Hartmann wins 2nd prize -- both prizes are the same: they each receive a voucher for a 14-day bus vacation trip to the south. Willy and Franz decide to take the winners with them on their vacation, in their own junk-heap of a minibus. Some friends of the winners join: Barbi insists she takes Harry with her as an escort, and Till will take his girlfriend Petra with him. Some band members also want to come along, too. And so this trip, originally for 2 persons, becomes a trip for 10 -- rather crowded for a small minibus, which will now be at full capacity.

The next day, just as the minibus is ready to leave, secretary Wilma (a friend of Barbi) joins the travelers, as does her boss Mr. Ratsam (who wanted to drive south, but his car broke down). After driving a long time, the gang pulls into a park, and they meet Mr. & Mrs. Stolze, and their ""underage"" daughter Anja (who is just a few days away from her 21st birthday), who is unhappy because her parents have arranged for her to marry John, who is a nice enough guy, but very boring.

Down the road, a big thunderstorm makes the group break into a huge bush-hut (the size of a barn) at night, and they play their musical instruments and dance. They play some lively dance numbers, like ""When the Saints Come Marching In,"" rather loud. An indignant policeman, upset by their disturbing the peace, shows up and tells them to leave at once. Anja, running away from home in a car she borrowed, catches up to the minibus and joins the gang.

Harry's father Walter is worried that his son is traveling with so many young women, since he actually wants to couple him with the manufacturer's daughter Gina. In Trieste, eventually Harry falls in love with Gina. After some chaos, Anja's parents are happy to get rid of the fiance John, and agree to let Anja date Franz.

Her rabbit friend, Haeschen, lives with Grandmother and was sent one day to fetch medicine and milk from Rotaeppchen and her mother. Although her mother was reluctant to allow her to visit Grandmother alone, Rotkaeppchen convinces her that she will be safe with Haeschen. Together they set out through the woods. Unfortunately, there were many distractions in the woods: mushrooms to pick and Rotkaeppchen's other playmate, the bear. There are also the dangerous fox and wolf, who plotted to capture Rotkaeppchen and eat her. Haeschen did his best to keep them safe, but he could not prevent the wolf from eating Grandmother . . . and also Rotkaeppchen! Who will save them? The DEFA version of Rotkaeppchen differs from the Grimms' version in some minor areas: the mother plays a greater role in the film; DEFA has the father save the day, rather than the huntsman; the wolf does not die at the end, though he is carried away by the family; the second encounter with the wolf at the end of the original tale is left out; and a few animal characters are added (Haeschen, Baer, and das Eichhoernchen). All the animals (other than the Eichhoernchen) are played by people in animal costumes, and Jochen Bley as Haeschen was the big hit with critics and viewers alike. Both warmly and critically received by the press upon its release, Rotkaeppchen followed closely on the heels of the very successful Schneewittchen; hence, in some cases, the disappointment. Many reviews cited Goetz Friedrich's background in theater (both in positive and negative interpretations) to explain the spare, two-dimensional feel of the set. Yet nearly all commented positively on the color and interesting characters, and the Progress press materials summed up the morals for the viewers to learn: ""Do what you are told, but act independently when it is necessary; never leave the path, especially the path that your friends have marked with love and experience; be brave, fight against evil, help your friends."" Since its release, Rotkaeppchen has become one of the most popular DEFA fairy tale films.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0056430/?ref_=sr_i_518,"['Gudrun Deubener', 'Hans Rodenberg']",['Götz Friedrich'],"['Blanche Kommerell', 'Helga Raumer', 'Horst Kube', 'Friedel Nowack', 'Werner Dissel', 'Harald Engelmann', 'Ernst-Georg Schwill', 'Jochen Bley', 'Waltraud Lohrmann']",,,,,"July 13, 1962",['East Germany'],,"['DEFA-Studio für Spielfilme', ""Künstlerische Arbeitsgruppe ''Berlin''""]",,"['Family', 'Fantasy']",['German']
