292. Fido,2006,1h 33m,R,6.7,31K,70.0,"In an Earthly world resembling the 1950s, a cloud of space radiation has shrouded the planet, resulting in the dead becoming zombies that desire live human flesh. A company called Zomcon has been able to control the zombie population. Zombies can be temporarily neutralized by being shot, but can only be permanently neutralized by their brain being destroyed. Their ultimate disposal is through cremation, or burial, the latter which requires decapitation with the head being buried separately from the body. Conversely, Zomcon has created the domestication collar, when activated and placed on a zombie makes the zombie controllable, and thus an eternally productive creature within society. Because all dead initially become zombies, the elderly are viewed negatively and suspectly. And all people, adult or child, learn to shoot to kill to protect society. Zomcon is the go to organization for all things zombie. In the town of Willard, the Robinsons - father Bill (Dylan Baker), mother Helen (Carrie-Anne Moss), and adolescent son Timmy (Kesun Loder) - are one family who don't own a zombie as a domestic, since Bill is afraid of zombies, as, when he was a child, he had to shoot his own zombie father, who tried to eat him. Bill has thus become fascinated with funerals to see zombies put away permanently. But Helen feels pressured to get a zombie when Zomcon's new head of security in Willard, the officious Jonathan Bottoms (Henry Czerny), moves into the neighborhood with his family. Never having had to deal with a zombie directly, Timmy is initially wary of their zombie. But as a lonely child who has no friends and is often bullied, Timmy eventually befriends their zombie, who he names Fido (Sir Billy Connolly), as he treats the zombie much like a faithful pet dog. Timmy protects Fido at all cost, even after Fido, due to no fault of its own, is implicated in some deaths, which creates a mini-wave of loose zombies unknown to Zomcon. But Fido may play a larger role within the family as a companion for Helen, who is largely neglected by Bill, since he sees human affection as ultimately resulting in such difficult issues as what happened between him and his own father. With Timmy and Helen treating Fido with kindness, Fido, in turn, may prove that not all zombies, even when without their domestication collar, are out to kill anyone and everyone in their path.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0457572/?ref_=sr_i_292,"['Robert Chomiak', 'Andrew Currie', 'Dennis Heaton']",['Andrew Currie'],"['Kesun Loder', 'Billy Connolly', 'Carrie-Anne Moss', 'David Kaye', 'Jan Skorzewski', 'Kevin Tyell', 'Andrew Parkin', 'Lynn Pendleton', 'Gary Slater', 'Taylor Petri']","$8,000,000 (estimated)","$10,203","$426,224","$304,533","March 16, 2007",['Canada'],"['Kelowna, British Columbia, Canada']","['Lionsgate', 'Anagram Pictures', 'Astral Media']","Awards, 13 wins & 15 nominations total","['Dark Comedy', 'Parody', 'Satire', 'Zombie Horror', 'Comedy', 'Drama', 'Horror', 'Sci-Fi']",['English']

The film delivers a surprisingly candid look at Robert Wilson, who drops his characteristic reticence and speaks with unprecedented candor about his personal life. Nothing is left in the shadows, as he discusses his troubled and lonely childhood as the son of the Mayor of Waco, Texas, his early learning disabilities, his work with disabled children using therapy as a tool for artistic expression, his departure from Texas at the time of his coming out and his fascination with the downtown New York avant-garde scene of the late 60's. What emerges is a life full of impressions, colors and rhythms, making it all the more poignant how Wilson's early hardships ultimately shaped his ground-breaking aesthetic vision. More than a biography, the film becomes an exhilarating exploration of the transformative power of creativity itself and the inspirational tale of a shy, stuttering boy who grew up to become a fearless artist with a profoundly original perspective to share with the world.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0841992/?ref_=sr_i_402,['Katharina Otto-Bernstein'],['Katharina Otto-Bernstein'],"['Robert Wilson', 'Arnold Aronson', 'Robin Brentano', 'David Byrne', 'William S.
