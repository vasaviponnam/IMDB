412. Bobby Ware Is Missing,1955,1h 7m,Approved,7.2,41,,"After preparing part of a southern California granite quarry for dynamiting the following morning, a work crew leaves the area. Eleven-year-old Bobby Ware and his pal, twelve-year-old Mickey Goodwin, then arrive on their bicycles to explore and play on the heavy equipment. Deciding to climb up to the top of a ridge, the boys hide their bicycles in brush to prevent theft and set off. Upon reaching the top, however, Bobby stumbles and when Mickey tries to catch him, both fall into a ravine, landing on a shallow shelf, halfway down the dangerous incline. When Bobby's father George returns home from work to his wife Janet and younger children Sammy and Janey, Janet tells him that Bobby is late in coming home, but George decides that Bobby may simply have been delayed by a flat tire on his bicycle. Meanwhile, Max Goodwin, Mickey's father, learns from his housekeeper, Sophie, that his son is late for dinner. Later, when Bobby has not returned, George phones Sophie for news of the boys and also checks with Bobby's homeroom teacher, who suggests that he contact the sheriff's station. Darkness has fallen and the boys, cold and scared, are still stuck on the ledge, hoping that people are looking for them. Bobby prays for protection throughout the night. After George unsuccessfully searches the neighborhood, he phones Max, who is dining at a restaurant with Alfred Gledhill and another business associate, and Max agrees to meet George at the sheriff's station. At George's request, Lt. Andy Flynn issues a bulletin to all patrol cars to be on the lookout for the boys and then arranges for a rescue squad, composed of professionals and volunteers, to be ready to begin a search at first light. George invites Max, who feels that he could have been a better, more accessible father to Mickey, to his house to wait for news. While they are there, a rock is thrown through a window. An attached note informs the fathers that if they want to see their boys again, they are to deliver ten thousand dollars in cash to a mailbox on an outlying road. Although George wants to inform the police about the kidnapping, both Janet and Max dissuade him and convince him to pay the ransom demand. At dawn, instead of joining Flynn's rescue crew to comb the nearby foothills, Max delivers the cash he has taken from his office safe to the drop point. George, meanwhile, decides to call off the search as the men and equipment might be needed for real emergencies, and locates Flynn close to the granite quarry. On the ledge, Bobby and Mickey hear an approaching helicopter, but it passes overhead and leaves without locating them. Although angered by the fathers' meddling, Flynn sets in motion a plan to trap the ""kidnapper"" when he appears to pick up the cash and also requests assistance from F.B.I. agent MacKay. Using stakeouts in unmarked vehicles, Flynn closes in on the kidnapper after he collects the cash and from his car's registration learns that he is Gledhill. Max then explains that Gledhill was with him when he learned that Mickey and Bobby were missing. The deputies pursue Gledhill in a high-speed car chase, which ends at a roadblock. Flynn and MacKay arrest Gledhill, who confesses to the extortion plot and then admits that he has no idea where the boys might be. Meanwhile, the blasting crew arrives at the quarry to begin the day's work. After Flynn reactivates the search party, he suddenly remembers that the blasting is about to begin and dispatches a squad car, which arrives just in time to prevent the explosions. The helicopter is in the air once more and the search crew is advancing through the area on foot when one of the men discovers the bicycles, which George identifies. As the helicopter approaches them again, the boys wave and this time are spotted by the crew. The ledge is impossible to reach on foot, so Flynn orders the helicopter to lower a harness and, in turn, both boys are lifted off the ledge into the helicopter. Bobby and Mickey are then reunited with their fathers.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0047893/?ref_=sr_i_412,['Daniel B.

Karunakaran (S. V. Subbaiah) and Vasudevan (Master Baji) are brothers whose parents had died. They are very much loving and close to each other but Vasudevan longs for mother's love.

Much to the relatives persuasion, Karunakaran accepts to marry Sulochana (Padmini). Vasudevan gets angry as he is notified regarding this and would accept not this wedding to take place if he does not like the bride. He sets off to the bride's house and he likes her at the first glimpse. The wedding takes place and Sulochana becomes a loving and passionate wife as well as sister-in-law. Vasudevan treats and accepts her as his own mother. Meanwhile, Sulochana gets pregnant and deliveres a baby boy but the baby dies soon after.

Time rolls on and Vasudevan becomes as an adult and becomes a college professor but unfortunately Karunakaran and Sulochana was not blessed with children. Vasudevan presents Sulochana gold bangles from his first pay. Vasudevan was arranged to marry Rao Bahadur Ponnambalam's (K. Sarangkapani) and Akilam's (K. N. Kamalam) daughter Prabha (M. N. Rajam).

Comic relief was presented in a moral story of Ponnambalam's family. Ponnambalam listens too much to and often quarrels with Akilam. This drives Ponnambalam's son Kalamani (K. A. Thangavelu) and his wife Neela (Ragini) to hatch a drama in order for Ponnambalam and Akilam to be united and respect each other. Kalamani and Neela succeeds in this.

Prabha's character was the opposite of Sulochana's but the latter least bother about this and carries on her daily good deeds. Prabha gets pregnant and deliveres a baby boy, Ravi (Master Ravi) but she does not care much for him. Sulochana picks up the tasks and takes care of Ravi as a mother should be of. As Ravi grows, Prabha does not like this and forbids Sulochana from raising Ravi.

Ravi falls ill due to the separation and Sulochana takes care of him day and night not bothering her meals and health. Ravi becomes very serious for a month till the doctor who treats him lose hope. Sulochana takes Ravi to a temple and pleads to Lord Shiva to take her life instead and spare Ravi's life. Prabha apologises to Sulochana but the latter says that it was by the God's grace before collapsing due to being too weak. Even in death bed, Sulochana enquires about Ravi's health. After thanking Karunakaran and Vasudevan for a good life as a daughter-in-law in the house and says that she would be reborn in this house, Sulochana dies.

Sulochana's body was cremated but Karunakaran and Vasudevan were surprised to see the gold bangles were not damaged during the process. A baby girl was born on the exact day after a year and she was accepted by the whole family as Sulochana reborn.
