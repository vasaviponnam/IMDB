While she has in the back of her mind that she would like to become a stage actress, she is less certain about her personal future. Although she has burgeoning sexual feelings for her boyfriend Sandy Lamm, a nice Jewish boy whom she is expected to marry eventually, she isn't sure if she truly loves him. She wants some time away to discover whether she should accept his marriage proposal; in doing so, she meets several wannabe-suitors who will enter, leave, and re-enter her life during her young adulthood. The one she believes that she is truly in love with is Noel Airman, 14 years her senior, who is social director of South Wind, a summer resort in the Catskills, when they first meet. Much like Marjorie's chosen life path is against the tradition envisioned by her opinionated mother, Rose Morgenstern, who hopes that acting is just a phase and Marjorie will settle into the life of a homemaker and mother, Noel has taken a similarly unconventional life path, bucking an envisioned professional life for one in the arts; he is adored as a genius by those at South Winds as he is writing a Broadway play. What those at South Winds do not see is Noel's time away from South Winds; he has a tendency to not finish what he starts, which might be one reason he never sees himself getting married. What Rose might find more egregious about Noel as Marjorie's potential husband is the fact that he turned his back on his Jewish heritage. As Noel contemplates settling into a more conventional life with Marjorie, can the love they think they have for each other overcome these obstacles?",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0051911/?ref_=sr_i_158,"['Everett Freeman', 'Herman Wouk']",['Irving Rapper'],"['Gene Kelly', 'Natalie Wood', 'Claire Trevor', 'Everett Sloane', 'Martin Milner', 'Carolyn Jones', 'George Tobias', 'Martin Balsam', 'Jesse White', 'Edd Byrnes']",,,,,"April 24, 1958",['United States'],"['Schroon Lake, New York, USA']",['Beachwold Productions'],"Nominated for 1 Oscar, 5 wins & 3 nominations total","['Drama', 'Romance']","['English', 'Hebrew', 'Spanish', 'Italian']"

441. The Notorious Mr. Monks,1958,1h 10m,Approved,6.4,18,,"In Central California, hitchhiker Dan Flynn comes across drunken Ben Monks, passed out at the wheel of his parked car. While Dan is combing through Ben's wallet to locate his address, Chip Klamp drives by and, after accusing Dan of planning to rob Ben, proclaims that Ben is ""a bad man"" and drives away. Dan drives Ben home, where Ben's wife Angela invites him in. Angie, who married the much older Ben because he promised her there was millions of dollars worth of oil on his farm, has grown weary of his alcoholism and abusiveness. Attracted to Dan, she offers him a job on the farm, and with no other prospects, he accepts. In the morning, Ben gruffly negotiates a low wage for Dan, and over the next days pushes him to work long hours. One night, after Angie informs Dan about the oil, he is about to kiss her when Ben drives up. Two weeks go by during which Dan chafes under Ben's ill-treatment. One afternoon, upon seeing Ben whipping his overburdened horse, Dan tries to intercede and when Ben snaps the whip on Dan's back, Dan punches him. Back at the house, Angie defends Ben as a sad old man, after which Dan lashes out at her. When he apologizes, she begs him to stay. Later, Chip, who used to date Angie, informs her that he has had his neighboring land surveyed and discovered there is no oil, then tells Ben that Angie is having an affair with Dan. A drunken Ben drives home without realizing that young runaway Gilda Hadley is hiding in his back seat. At the farm, when Ben accuses Angie of cheating, she retorts that he lied about the oil and calls him old, prompting him to hit her, after which he pleads with her not to leave him. Ben retreats to the barn, where he finds Gilda and agrees to hide her in the loft. Just then, Dan arrives with the veterinarian, hoping to save Ben's ailing horse, but they are too late. Ben throws a bottle at Dan, who attacks him, but their fight is cut short by the entrance of the sheriff, who is searching for Gilda. Despite the sheriff's offer to share the reward offered by her wealthy father, Ben declares that he has not seen the girl. Meanwhile, Angie visits Dan as he packs to leave. Assuming she told Ben that they were lovers, Dan rejects her advances, then returns to the barn to demand his pay from Ben. Finding Ben on the ground, Dan assumes he is passed out and takes his car, not knowing that Gilda is again hiding in it. On the road, Gilda tells Dan that she is running away from her boyfriend, and that she dropped her locket in the Monkses' barn. Chip sees Ben's car pass and heads to the barn, where the sheriff has found Ben, dead from a head wound. Upon spotting the locket on the ground, Chip pockets it surreptitiously. That night, Gilda admits to Dan that she is fleeing to protest her father's remarriage, two years after her mother's death. Although she tries to seduce Dan, he firmly rebuffs the teenager, instead offering to help her return home. As soon as they stop, however, Dan is spotted by the police and arrested for Ben's murder. At the trial, Angie vouches for Dan's trustworthiness but her testimony about his fights with Ben damage Dan's case. With strong circumstantial evidence against Dan, who was the last to see Ben alive, his only hope lies in locating Gilda, who was watching from the loft and so may have seen the real killer. His lawyer is granted three days to find her, and while they wait, Chip visits Angie to demand her attentions. She throws him out, and after he drops his wallet, she discovers the locket inside and brings it to Dan's lawyer. Soon after, Gilda turns herself in and takes the witness stand, where she recounts what happened the night Ben died: After the other men leave, Ben climbs into the loft and tries to assault Gilda. In self-defense, she pushes him to the ground, and thinking he is merely unconscious, flees to his car. After exhibiting Gilda's locket as evidence of her presence in the barn, Dan's lawyer asks for more time to uncover the murder weapon, and soon a bloody anvil is found buried in the hay in the barn. The judge rules that the death occurred accidentally when Ben fell from the loft and hit his head on the anvil, and Dan is freed. As Chip is brought before the judge to be punished for withholding evidence, Gilda's father offers Dan a job in Los Angeles and Gilda hugs Dan goodbye. As he is leaving, Dan hears his lawyer thank Angie for her help, and he tells her she is a ""swell gal."" Although Angie is in love with Dan, she bravely bids him goodbye.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0052010/?ref_=sr_i_441,"['Paul Fix', 'Richard C.
