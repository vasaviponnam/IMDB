495. Becoming Katharine Graham,2025,1h 32m,,8.4,31,,"Becoming Katharine Graham tells the story of a painfully shy woman's accidental rise to power and how it changed history.

Born in 1917, Katharine Graham-known as ""Kay""-was raised to adhere to the expectation that men would have careers, and women would raise the family. Kay, like most other women at the time, abided by these societal norms. But the course of her life would drastically change once her father, financier Eugene Meyer, bought a struggling newspaper at public auction in 1933.

This struggling newspaper was The Washington Post, and it was on the brink of collapse. The paper's performance incrementally improved under her father's leadership; Mr. Meyer poured his own money into the business to ensure its growth. Then, in 1946, Mr. Meyer handed control of the newspaper over to the next generation. A product of his own times, Mr. Meyer never considered giving the ""Publisher"" title to his daughter, even though she had quietly participated in the initial struggle to keep the paper afloat and had worked as a journalist both in San Francisco and at The Washington Post. Instead, he bequeathed the title and two-thirds ownership of the paper to her husband Phil Graham exclaiming that ""no man should work for his wife."" The performance of the paper grew exponentially under Phil's leadership, but his suicide in 1963 left Kay with a leaderless newspaper and four young children, forcing Kay to decide whether to take over the cherished family business herself or sell it.

Although a self-proclaimed ""doormat wife,"" Kay made the difficult and unprecedented decision to keep the paper in the family and run it herself. She initially imagined she would serve as a figurehead-a somewhat silent placeholder-until her eldest son, Don, could take her place as Publisher. Yet, over the course of the following decades, Kay proved to be a vocal and incredibly important leader of The Washington Post. She worked hard to learn the newspaper business inside out, while simultaneously gaining confidence in her own abilities and earning respect within the male-dominated industry.

Over the course of her career, she rose to become one of the most powerful newspaper publishers of the 20th century. Kay had the courage to publish the ""Pentagon Papers"", stand behind the paper's historic Watergate reporting, and withstand the infamous 1975 pressmen's strike that threatened the very existence of the paper.

At its heart, Becoming Katharine Graham highlights pivotal events of the 1970s that occurred under Kay's leadership difficulties she endured as one of the first female leaders in corporate America. Featuring interviews with colleagues, friends, and family, and relying heavily on archival footage to bring Kay's own voice to the forefront, the film presents a nuanced portrait of Kay and pays homage to her inspiring role as a trailblazer for women in both journalism and corporate leadership. Her Pulitzer Prize winning story is sure to inspire a new generation.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt34772319/?ref_=sr_i_495
