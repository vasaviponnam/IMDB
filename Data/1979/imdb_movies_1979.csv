Un hombre y una mujer van en un coche;´él, Bernardo (Ángel Jové) conduce y se queja de que le duelen las muelas. Ella, Eloísa (Consul Tura) le dice que le pida dinero a Tía Lina (Sara Grey) , ya que si es para el dentista sí qeu se lo dará. Él dice que quiere que se muera de una vez, para poder heredar. La pareja lleva a Dany (), un perro caniche, en el coche.

Corte a una carrera de perros. La mujer no presta atención, y murmura que seguro que él ha perdido todo el dinero.

De regreso a la casa, Dany sale corriendo por la finca. Eloísa sale corriendo detrás de él, casi parece presa del pánico. Bernardo, que está limpiando un pequeño estanque de ramas podridas y animales muertos, lo sujeta. Eloísa le dice que no se pase, que le está haciendo daño, a lo que Bernardo responde que debería vigilarolo más y no dejarlo salir de la casa. Eloísa bate la comida y también le pone la comida al perro, y deja todos los cacharros en el fregadero para fregar más tarde. Mientras los perros comen, Eloísa se corta las uñas de los pies y se pinta las uñas; Bernardo toca el piano y se pone una de las cremas del perro en el pie. a Eloísa eso le parece asqueroso, pero él le dice que si a Dany le viene bien, a él también le funcionará.

Más tarde, con todo desordenado, Dany se pone a alisquear la ropa interior usada de Eloísa. Eloísa y Bernardo se están vistiendo para ir a visitar a la tía Lina. Bernardo no quiere cambiar la hora de la visita, pero tampoco quiere ir a verla. Eloísa comenta que necesitan el dinero de Lina para vivir. Eloísa detecta un parásito en Dany, y Bernardo se lo quita con unas pinzas de depilar. Eloísa le dice que no mate al bicho y que limpie las pinzas. Barnardo estruja a la pulga, o lo que fuese, y después simplemente pasa las pinzas por debajo del grifo abierto.

Bernardo en el dentista (Marcelo Íbero), que le da recuerdos para Eloísa. Después, visitando a Lina, hay bronca a gritos. Ella le dice que son manías suyas, y que debería trabajar. Bernardo se queja de que no les da suficiente dinero, y que por eso la tienen que visitar continuamente. Tía Lina se mete con la madre de Bernardo, lo que enfurece a Bernardo. Cuando se acalora, Lina se agobia y no da respirado. Tienen una cuidadora, Marta (Isabel Heredia), que le pone un respirador en la boca. Bernardo no se cree nada: él siempre recuerda a tía Lina medio enferma.

De vuelta a casa, conduciendo por la noche, Bernardo se para en mitad de la carretera para llamar a un perro abandonado. Una vez en casa, Eloísa ve la tele en cama, abrazada al caniche. Bernardo está disecando a un animal, y afuera se oyen aullar a unos perros.

Bernardo no aparece al día siguiente. Eloísa le pone el colirio en el ojo al perro, y tiene que limpiar el sitio donde el caniche se ha meado. Saca carne de la nevera y se la va dando a comer a trocitos. Bernardo sigue limpiando la piscina, ahora medio vacía, y para ello usa un cuadro viejo.

En el cine, Bernardo y Eloísa ven una película en la que aparecen muchos perros. Al acabar, un presentador habla de una nueva urbanización que está proyectada para que vivan perros. Dos ejecutivos (Carlos Martos y Miguel Avilés) intentan vender la idea a los inversores, gente que parece de clase media. A la salida, unas azafatas reparten panfletos. Eloísa estaría encantada de contribuir al proyecto, pero no tiene dinero. El veterinario, el doctor Alberto Agal (Cruz Tobar) pregunta a Eloísa por la salud de Dany, y le recomienda que le haga comer verduras, pero ella dice que no las traga.

De regreso a casa, Eloísa y Bernardo tienen una bronca, porque ella les daría dinero para que llevasen a cabo el proyecto si lo tuviese, mientras que Bernardo piensa que todo son tonterías. En la bronca, se deduce que no son un matrimonio, sino hermanos, - nacidos de la misma madre. Bernardo se cabrea tanto que decide andar el resto del camino, a pesar del frío. Ve unos perros en una casa que le gruñen, y él se entretiene chasqueándoles los dedos, hasta que la gente de la casa se despierta y va a ver que pasa. Por el camino también se encuentra a unos perros abandonados que están comiendo los restos de la basura; improvisa un collar a uno de ellos y se lo lleva. Mientras Eloísa ya está en casa, calmando a Dany porque una tormenta ha estallado, Bernardo vuelve andando y se va empapando. Desde su ventana, Eloísa ve a Bernardo - que se protege con un plástico - y al nuevo perro. Bernardo tiene que tirar de él para hacerle andar. Se oye ladrar al nuevo perro, pero no se ve qué pasa. Mientras tanto, Eloísa se unta miel en su sexo y atrae a Dany hacia ella.

Más tarde, Bernardo bebe, ya sin que se vea al nuevo perro, y mientras tanto, Eloísa está sientiendo placer sexual por las caricias de Dany, supuestamente al lamerle la miel. Bernardo oye sus gemidos y se mete en la habitación de al lado. Dany duerme con Eloísa, que lo abraza.

Al día siguiente, Bernardo toca el piano mientras Eloísa le corta las uñas a Dany. Operan a la tía Lina de urgencia, aunque es difícil saber si se salvará. A Eloísa le asustan los cambios, pero su hermano sólo se preocupa de donde van a ir a cenar.

Bernardo va a buscar a otro perro a un criadero o a la perrera municipal. Escoge lo que parece un mastín negro, y lo encierra en el maletero.

Corte a un sacerdote (Buenaventura Martínez), que está bendiciendo al cuerpo de Lina, ya en un ataud. Durante la bendición, se oye los gemiditos que lanza Dany, a quien Eloísa ha colado en la iglesia metido en un bolso de mano.

El agua de la piscina parece ahora más limpia; las cacerolas roñosas han dejado sitio a una olla exprés reluciente; la batidora es nueva y moderna; todo parece más limpio; la montaña de platos nuevos y relucientes, de porcelana, antes no estaba; Bernardo viste con un conjunto de pantalones cortos de tenis nuevos; hasta hay más cantidad de carne para Dany: se nota que han cobrado la herencia de la tía Lina. Vestida con un traje más elegante, Eloísa se mete en un coche recién comprado con elevalunas eléctrico. Eloísa deja a Dany sujeto a un palo en el jardín para que el cesped amortigüe el dolor de las patitas. Dany mete el perro dentro de la casa, donde se le escapa, ante la mirada del nuevo criado de la casa. Mientras va a buscarlo, Bernardo dice que a Dany no le gusta quedarse a solas con él.

Como Bernardo tiene ahora su propio coche nuevo, coge a Dany y se van los dos. Sin embargo, le chilla, gritando que antes él estaba mejor y más cómodo. Bernardo dice que él también quiere a Eloísa, pero que ella lo prefiere a Dany. Tanto él como su hermana han ido a buscar más perros. Un domesticador alemán (Werner Delil) enseña lo muy educados que están sus perros. Carmen (Marta Molins) le prepara tres cachorros a Eloísa, mientras que su empleado (Francisco Rodríguez) se pregunta qué demonios hacen con tantos perros. La señora Carmen le dice que no haga preguntas.

Eloísa lleva a los cachorritos a la cocina: dice a su hermano que no quiere perros de la perrera porque podrían pasarles cualquier enfermedad. Bernardo se ha comprado una caja de ritmos en lugar del viejo piano. Se supone que Eloísa mata y cocina a los perros. Esa tarde-noche, Alberto viene a cenar con ellos, invitado, y dice que Eloísa cada vez cocina mejor. Dany come con ellos a la mesa. Alberto les explica cómo va el proyecto en el que han invertido tanto dinero, pero Bernardo se levanta, diciendo que no tiene apetito y que no se encuentra bien. Ahora tienen hasta un pequeño cien en casa, y la nevera vuelve a estar abarrotada de carne cruda. Mientras los demás se quedan ablando en la sobremesa, Bernardo sale en la noche a la perrera a coger algún perro, y de hecho vuelve con un perro nuevo a casa.

Al llegar, ve a Eloísa ofreciéndose a Alberto, y a éste meterle mano a ella, que al finay al cabo está mucho más arreglada y mejor vestida. Alberto se va, quedando con ellos al día siguiente a las 11 de la mañana. Después, los hermanos discuten. Eloísa quiere hacer una visita de obras con Alberto, pero Bernardo, cada vez bebiendo más, se niega a ir. Bernardo destroza un pastel de bodas sin empezar que había en la casa - ni idea de por qué - y luego se va a vomitar al jardín, ahora mucho más arreglado y el césped igualadísimo. Eloísa se toma una pastilla para dormir y obliga a Dany a tomar otra.

Eloísa y Alberto visitan el cementerio de perros. Los ejecutivos son también amables con ella al saber que es una de las accionistas. Alberto le regala la tumba para Dany en el futuro. Bernardo no se comunica con nadie, enfurruñado. Una réplica cutre del retrato de la duquesa de Alba que antes estaba en la casa de Lina está ahora en la habitación de Eloísa. Ella lleva a Dany a la ópera, mientras que Bernardo sigue enfurruñado. Alberto recomienda a Eloísa que se separe un poco de él cuando ella le dice que está celoso de él y del perro.

Bernardo se ha ido y está acariciando a un perro. Cuando su hermana llega a casa, como de costumbre él no oye como lo llama. Su hermana entra y lo descubre penetrando sexualmente al perro, al que le ha atado las patas. A pesar de los gritos de su hermana, no pasa, así que ella acaba golpeándole con un palo. Se caen los dos al suelo y él parece desmayarse. Eloísa llora sobre su pecho y le dice que no pueden seguir así. Poco a poco, él parece reaccionar. Sin embargo, sigue teniendo temblores, o un ataque de algún tipo. Eloísa le da una de sus pastillas a su hermano, pero éste no quiere tomarla; tampoco quiere ver a Dany, lo que aún hace llorar más a Eloísa. Esa noche, Eloísa duerme en un sofá con el caniche en sus rodillas.

Esa noche, Bernardo se levanta y le mete la cabeza entre las piernas a Eloísa. Cuando ella se despierta, a él le da otro ataque. Al final, ella llama a Alberto, pero no está en casa. Sin embargo, Bernardo da andado por su propio pie, aunque en un estado febril. Acorrala a Dany en la cocina, y cuando la dueña lo busca, lo encuentra aterrorizado, escondido en un rincón. Bernardo anda como sonámbulo por el jardín de la casa, mientras que Dani se queda encerrado en el baño y con la bañera echando agua. Bernardo se dedica a jugar al escondite y Dany intenta buscar una salida, ya que Eloísa lo ha dejado encerrado en el baño. El perro grande ladra, lo que atrae la atención de Eloísa. Febrilmente, Bernardo se está comportando con un perro, pero cuando su hermana se le acerca, intenta tener relaciones sexuales con ella. Ella llora, aunque hay momentos en que llama por su nombre a su hermano, y otras, a su perro.

El caniche sigue dando vueltas y vueltas intentando salir. El teléfono suena, pero entre los ladridos del perro, la bomba del agua, ni Bernardo ni Eloísa lo oyen. Él la penetra por detrás.

Al día siguiente, muy de mañana, Alberto se decide a visitarlos. Nadie le abre la verja, ´pero se oyen los ladridos del perro grande a lo lejos, así que se la salta y entra en la casa. Abre la puerta a Dany, que sale corriendo de la casa y su finca. Guiado por los ladridos del perro grande, aún atado a una estantería, Alberto se encuentra a los dos hermanos dormidos uno al lado del otro, alla medio desnuda. Hay sangre por todas partes, y ella parece muerta. El perro grande sigue ladrando.

Alberto sale de la casa, se mete en el coche y se va.

Primer plando de la piscina, ahora relucientemente limpia, y del cielo azul.

Tráfico en una calle de Madrid. Dany baja corriendo un montón de escaleras. Se mete entre el tráfico y la gente, llegando a ocasionar un accidente. Es un día lluvioso. Dos señoras (Asunción ruiz y Natalia soler-Nou) mayores recogen a Dany y se lo llevan, probablemente a casa.
