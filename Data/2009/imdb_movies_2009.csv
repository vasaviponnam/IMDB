According to the U.S. Department of Education national testing, only 35% of American high school seniors are proficient in reading, based on 2006 data. And fewer than one-in-four, 23%, are proficient in math. On the global stage, America ranks last in educational effectiveness among large industrialized countries despite the highest spending per student in the world. It presents a conundrum: How has the richest and most innovative society on earth suddenly lost the ability to teach its children at a level that other modern countries consider ""basic""? If the problem is that we're not spending enough on schools, which many people believe, it's instructive to study the U.S. state that spends more than any other per student: New Jersey With spending as high as $483,000 per classroom (confirmed by NJ Education Department records for 2005-06), New Jersey students fare only slightly better than the national average in reading and math, and rank 37th in average SAT scores. And not even half of NJ's high school freshmen, despite the state's enormous ""investment,"" are academically ready for college four years later. The fact is much of the public considers teacher salaries and overall education budgets to be the same thing -- if you're for raising one, you must be for raising the other. But as the film shows, in many cases 80-90% of the spending goes somewhere besides teacher salaries. In fact billions of dollars, as confirmed by independent audits, are wasted. ""The Cartel"" investigates what is causing this vast underachievement and what can be done to turn things around.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1433001/?ref_=sr_i_334

363. Love N' Dancing,2009,1h 31m,PG-13,5.4,2K,43,"2002: Jake Mitchell is the defending World West Coast Swing Champion. He's got everything going for him: looks, personality, and style. He's at the top of his game when he and his partner Corinne are crowned the unexpected winners at the World Swing Dance Championships. As the crowd cheers and the celebration begins, Jake appears uneasy. Did he really deserve to win? The music blasts and the bass is thumping, and Jake hears none of it. He feels it. Jake is completely deaf, due to an ear infection when he was a teenager. He learned how to dance by feeling the vibrations of the music. Now he feels something else: that perhaps the judges gave him the win out of sympathy. Present Day: Jessica Donovan's life is boring. When she was younger, she was a dancer who had dreams of Broadway. Now she's an English teacher for disinterested, upper class middle school kids, and she's dying to let loose. Her fiancee Kent is a work-a-holic who cares more about making money than making Jessica happy. Jake's moved on with his life and he's now a dance teacher who travels around the country doing motivational speaking to students about how his disability did not hold him back. It's at a school assembly where Jake and Jessica first meet. He's up on stage telling kids that you have to believe in yourself. The spoiled rich kids show no interest at first, but Jake's charm and sense of humor gets them to laugh. Then his former partner Corinne joins him onstage and they dance. The crowd goes nuts! Jake meets Jessica and there's an instant connection; there's only one problem. Jake's still in love with Corinne and perhaps always will be. And Corinne knows exactly how to get under Jake's skin. Though she has a fiancee, she drives Jake nuts with her flirtatious ways. Jessica initially asks Jake to train both her and her fiancee in West Coast Swing for their wedding, but Jake and Jessica are drawn closer when Kent's non-stop job prevents him from going to the class. Jessica decides to take lessons from Jake... perhaps they can compete at the World Championships of Swing in the Pro-Am division? And they get better and better. They decide, at a dance party, to go for it all. Forget the Pro-Am; they want to try for the title that Jake felt he never deserved. But now the champions are all 18 year olds who can defy gravity, and Jake's in his early thirties. To make matters worse, Corinne gets word that her old partner has a new partner, and suddenly, she's interested in Jake again. Jake and Jessica must try to elude all obstacles, romantic or otherwise, to stay focused on the goal... winning the World Title and winning each other.

It begins in 1993, when a young man from Belgium looking to change his life has an unexpected encounter in Central Park. He meets a hawk. Not just any hawk, but a wild Redtail, a fierce predator that has not lived in the City for almost a hundred years. Compelled to follow this extraordinary creature, he buys a video camera and sets out to track the hawk. Little does he know that the journey will take him almost twenty years and lead him down many trails of life, death, birth, hope, and redemption. Affectionately known to New Yorkers as Pale Male, the hawk becomes a magnificent obsession and a metaphor for triumph against all odds. His nest, perched on a posh 5th Avenue co-op, starts out as a novel curiosity to a handful of avid birdwatchers but becomes an international tourist destination - a place of pilgrimage. Then, on a December afternoon without warning, in the space of half an hour, the building dismantles Pale Male's beloved nest. In a wingbeat, media from around the world assemble on 5th Avenue to cover the unprecedented protest. Gathering behind Pale Male is an army of birdwatchers, movie stars, poets, children, dogs, and late night comedy show hosts.

Meanwhile, a rising radio personality from Los Angeles reluctantly drives through the hot desert toward Coyote County. His name is Jack Proctor. Upon visiting K-RAP, Jack meets the motley crew that works to keep the place running. These odd but charming individuals are a snapshot representation of the population living in this desert region. Jack meets Mr. Sanchez, the ""maintenance engineer"" and host of a ""fix it"" show; Raymond, the former-military accountant and host of an alien and paranormal phenomena talk show; Doyle, the sound engineer and host of a technology ""geek"" show; Mrs. Hopps, host of a cooking show and owner of a local caf√© where everyone loves to eat and hang out; and Lauren, the assistant station manager, who until now has been the star of K-RAP with her ""Heart Smart"" show receiving the highest ratings. She is the most respected member of the crew, constantly aiding other hosts in improving their content. Lauren is less than thrilled about the big-city hotshot coming to try and fix their problems. She feels threatened and does little to hide her dislike for Jack. The ratings begin to show that their on-air skirmishing - taking shots at one another on their respective ""relationship advice"" talk shows - is drawing interest to the radio station. During one of their off-air battles, Lauren questions Jack's ability to counsel people regarding love and romance. Jack accepts the challenge and goes a step further to prove his point, claiming that he can help the biggest loser in the county to find real love. He initiates an on-air publicity stunt, asking for applicants from all over Coyote County who think they are the biggest loser and least likely to find love. Too prove that he, not Lauren, understands what true love is, Jack will help the loser woo any woman in Coyote County. Applications pour in to K-RAP from men trying to prove that they are the biggest loser and in need of Jack's love advice to find a mate. A loser is chosen who stands out above the rest as the least likely to attract and charm a woman - Lyle Grincher. Jack then begins counseling the Loser on air and ratings increase further. The radio station is now back in the black with the highest number of listeners ever. However tension also increases between Jack and Lauren. Plot thickens, stakes rise and metaphors get mixed when the audience discovers that Jack's advice is working too well, and the woman that the Loser has chosen to woo is none other than Lauren. Before this romantic battle-of-the-sexes is over, Jack and Lauren will learn what being a winner and loser really means, and more importantly, realize that true love is selfless love.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1144541/?ref_=sr_i_415
