The German-American Hendricks is secretly in league with Takimura and the others, and allows them to use the radio station's transmitter to relay signals to Japanese ships late at night. After leaving Satsuma's home, Mike goes to the morgue, where his pal Jerry shows him a decapitated corpse. Mike recognizes the body as Oshima's from a scar on his shoulder and realizes that the mode of killing indicates that his friend was murdered by the Black Dragon Society. On 4 December 1941, police captain Wade informs Mike that pressure from prominent Japanese businessmen has resulted in his transfer to another precinct, to take effect in four days. Mike asserts that the transfer proves he is close to catching the spies, and his refusal to cease his investigation prompts Takimura to use Teru as bait in a trap. On the night of 6 December, Teru invites Mike to Satsuma's house, where she drugs him. As Mike sleeps, Hendricks and Takimura kill Teru and make it look as if Mike murdered her while trying to assault her. Mike is arrested for the murder, and the next morning, is in prison when he learns of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. Mike then escapes from jail and soon discovers where Takimura, Hendricks and the others meet. With Maris' help, Mike tricks the spies into revealing their activities while the police listen, and soon the gang is rounded up. After Japanese Americans on the West Coast are taken to internment camps, Little Tokyo becomes a ghost town, and Maris comments on her radio show that loyal Japanese Americans must suffer along with the disloyal in the interest of national security. She then reads an excerpt of Robert Nathan's poem ""Watch America,"" and urges Americans to maintain their vigilance against espionage.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0034983/?ref_=sr_i_319,['George Bricker'],['Otto Brower'],"['Preston Foster', 'Brenda Joyce', 'Harold Huber', 'Donald Douglas', 'June Duprez', 'George E.

The spies then stick the message, which states that a Tokyo battleship is approaching Pearl Harbor, to a bottle of German liquor called Kümmel. Just then, the womanizing private Steve ""Lucky"" Smith meets his fellow soldiers Bruce Gordon and ""Portly"" Porter in the Casa Marina bar, and Lucky and Steve both try to attract a beautiful woman, who soon informs them she is Portly's sister Marcia. Portly arranges a job for Marcia as the secretary to Andy L. Anderson, the owner of the bar. When a businessman named Littlefield slips into Marcia's booth and bothers her while reading the message on the bottle of Kümmel, Lucky defends her by attacking Littlefield, and Bruce and Portly join the fight. Captain Hudson disciplines the three by assigning them to find the spy's radio. Though Lucky is in charge of the mission, he soon returns to the bar to find Marcia. Bruce and Portly, meanwhile, pick up a coded radio transmission from a Japanese boat and follow the beam to the hideout of Littlefield and his two henchmen. A gunfight erupts during which Portly is killed and Littlefield escapes, and when Lucky later admits to the captain that he was not there, the captain court-martials him and promotes Bruce to corporal. Lucky quickly escapes from jail and soon after, Anderson, who is one of the spies, meets with Van Hoorten, another Nazi who is posing as a Dutch Indian. They discuss the success of their plan to stockpile ammunition and gas for the Japanese troops who plan to invade. Anderson agrees to kill Littlefield and arrange for the gas to be transported to their warehouse, and when Lucky turns to Anderson for help, believing the bar owner to be a friend, Anderson slyly tips him off to Littlefield's whereabouts. That night, Lucky attacks Littlefield and Anderson shoots him, then offers Lucky the job of transporting some ""crude oil"" to his warehouse. On the way, Bruce stops Lucky's truck and asks him to turn himself in that evening. At the warehouse, Lucky realizes that the cargo is not crude oil but gasoline, and when he and Marcia sneak into Van Hoorten's office that night, they find ammunition and a Nazi flag. Just then, Van Hoorten bursts in and attacks them, forcing Lucky to shoot him. Then Bruce, who has tracked Lucky to the warehouse, runs in just as the radio announces that Pearl Harbor has been bombed. Before the three can leave, Japanese planes land in the nearby field and the soldiers enter the office with Anderson. The three Americans run into the hills, where they find a radio and wire Captain Hudson for help. When the American troops arrive, Hudson spots another Japanese aircraft carrier in the bay. Understanding that the Japanese will soon outnumber them, Lucky courageously saves the Americans by flying the armed Japanese plane into the carrier in a suicide mission.

Payne's system, which attempts to prevent favoritism, requires much hard work and restricts dating, and so the students decide to ruin Payne by creating a false student. They pool their papers and soon their creation, number 79, has won all the academic awards for the semester. Number 79, whom the students have named Patty Flynn, is to receive an award at a school assembly, and the co-eds, led by Sally Carlyle, are chuckling over their victory when they are overheard by Payne's secretary, Agatha Frost. Agatha, who is known as Frosty, tells the girls that Payne will be fired and they will be expelled if their scheme is revealed, and so Sally calls New York, where fellow student Bingo Brown is picking up orchestrations for the music he composed for the upcoming school show. After Sally tells Bingo to hire someone to play Patty, he approaches would-be singer Betty Reilly. At first Patty refuses his proposal, despite his assertion that she could be discovered by Broadway producer Max Hillman, who will be at the school show. Betty changes her mind, however, when her bumbling brother Eddie and his pal, Nick Cramer, reveal that they ""borrowed"" a race horse, entered it in a race in her name and are now wanted by the police. Betty goes to the college to hide out and arrives at the assembly just in time to collect the award for Patty Flynn. Payne is astonished by Betty's slang-filled speech, and in order to substantiate the charade, Betty convinces him that overwork due to his experimental system has caused her to have a nervous breakdown. She further convinces him that only relaxing his edicts about dating will prevent the other students from suffering a similar fate. Betty arranges for Payne to escort Sally to an upcoming dance, and after he kisses Sally during a rehearsal for the show, they realize that they are in love. Eddie's arrival ruins everything, however, for when he is picked up by the police, he is taken to Payne, to whom he reveals Betty's true identity. Furious about the deception but wanting to protect the kids, Payne resigns without telling Dean Andrew Wharton about their scheme. Payne then breaks up with Sally and castigates the students for their interference. He also tells them that they must stay in college rather than rush to join the military and fight in the war, for gaining knowledge is serving their country as well. The contrite students confess to Wharton, who agrees to reinstate Payne and expel them. When Wharton forbids them to hold the show, Payne and Frosty conspire to distract him while the kids perform. Wharton hears the music, however, and is about to cancel the show when the kids' final number, ""You Got to Study, Buddy,"" wins the approval of two visiting military officials with its theme of staying in school. Wharton signals his approval, Payne and Sally are reconciled and Betty is a success.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0035587/?ref_=sr_i_392,"['George Carleton Brown', 'Frank Gill Jr.']",['Albert S.

Jane and her Black servant Abraham loathe their new surroundings, and while Abraham copes with Nora's helper Pansy, Jane begins to attend school. Jane's arrogance drives away all potential friends except for young David Engstrom, who nominates her for membership in the local chapter of the 4-H Club. Jane, who has never heard of the youth-oriented organization, is unimpressed when she learns how it promotes agricultural skills and good citizenship. Jane declines membership but changes her mind upon discovering that handsome Jonathan Blake is the club's president. Jane's interest in Jonathan dismays quiet Elizabeth Barnes, who is in love with him. Elizabeth's weak-willed father tries to comfort her by promising to buy her a purebred Hereford calf for her 4-H state fair project, but he instead loses her money in a poker game held by shady entrepreneur Earl Tucker. When Barnes tells Earl about his dilemma, Earl obtains a mixed-breed calf, then forges papers certifying its lineage. Elizabeth is delighted with her calf, which she names ""Royal Jonathan II,"" and happily tends to him as the months pass. Jane also chooses a calf for her project and names it ""King Blake the First."" Pansy and Abraham, who have struck up a quarrelsome friendship, know that Jane is interested in 4-H only as a means to ensnare Jonathan in a romance, but Jonathan still courts Elizabeth. On the day of the fair, Jane has lunch with Earl, who intimates that she will win the contest because Elizabeth's calf is not purebred. Jane refuses to believe him but promises to buy his tractor with her prize money if she wins. Elizabeth wins, but Earl, desperate for the money, sends a telegram to the judges challenging Royal Jonathan's lineage. The calf's phony papers are exposed and Jane is declared the winner, but she is horrified by the proceedings, as Earl signed her name to the telegram. Barnes confesses all to his daughter, who protects him by refusing to explain the situation to the 4-H officials. Soon after, Elizabeth is suspended from the club, while Jane is ostracized by the other members for getting Elizabeth in trouble. Jonathan stands by Elizabeth, and the despondent Jane decides to return to the city. Before leaving, she sends Abraham to Earl's office to pay a bill, and while there, Abraham overhears two government agents question Earl about a man, Ivan Leslie, who is wanted for draft evasion. Abraham also overhears when a drunken Barnes tells Earl that he wants to reveal the truth about Elizabeth's calf. Abraham repeats the information to Jane, who captures the fleeing Earl and forces him to write a confession admitting full responsibility for the forged papers. The government agents then apprehend Earl, who is the draft dodger. Soon after, Elizabeth represents the club at a national 4-H meeting held in Washington, D.C., and says a fond hello to Jane and her fellow members during a radio broadcast.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0035585/?ref_=sr_i_502,['Samuel G.

550. Rodeo Rhythm,1942,1h 12m,Approved,5.3,16,,"One of the rarest, which is okay as it seldom even appears on the want lists of dedicated P.R.C. collectors (especially those who have seen it), and one of the oddest of the ""who-let-this-out"" films. Filmed on location in the Kansas City area, with only B-western star Fred Scott and actress Loie Bridge the only two in the cast who had ever been in a film (and Scott had none after this), and the only other Hollywood connections were director Fred C. Newmeyer, who hadn't had a directing job since 1937 and who chose to be billed as Fred Neymeyer here; cameraman Edward A. Kull, billed as Eddie Kull and editor George Halligan, who may have assumed it wouldn't be seen by anybody and kept his own name on the credits. At this period in time, actress Loie Bridge was a Kansas City residence herself. Sister of actor Alan Bridge, the pair had their start in Kansas City co-managing a stock company at the Empress Theatre, before brother Al headed for Minneapolis and, later, the bright lights of Tinseltown. Loie stayed at home in Kansas City running stock companies, with an occasional role in California in early 1930's B-westerns that usually had brother Al in the cast. Loie left Kansas City for good it appears circa 1942-43 and had a fair career as a character actress. Roy Knapp, a Kansas City dry cleaner, opened a kid's riding academy in that city circa 1926 and,in a few years, his troupe of riding young daredevils (ages from 4 years old to late teens) were performing in rodeos and livestock shows all over the American Midwest. One of the riding stars of the troupe was a 5-year-old girl named (correct spelling) Roylene ""Small Fry"" Smith, who evidently became Donna Jean Meinke somewhere along the way, according to the cast listing on the IMDb. While the film is a showcase for Roy Knapp's ""Rough Riders,"" it is not a story of the group, although ""Knapp"" is the character role names for Scott and Bridge, who play brother and sister. She plays Tillie Knapp, struggling to keep the Knapp Orphanage open. The highlight event at the Orphanage each year is the annual summer vacation visit the kids make to the ranch of her brother Buck, who sends her money to pay for the trip. Alas, this year, Alex Twitchell, local money-bag version of Snively Whiplash, has purchased the mortgage due on the orphanage and the Knapp Ranch, and demands immediate payment. Tillie gives him all the money that had been saved for the trip. To keep the kids, orphans all, from being disappointed, her old vaudeville partner, Joe Stegge, takes her and the kids to the ranch in his truck. The kids learn that Uncle Buck and Aunt Tillie are in dire straits and enlist the aid of Jim Corey, a former member of the orphanage, and Ellie Knapp, Buck's daughter, to help them put on a rodeo and use the money to help Aunt Tillie. Whiplash, uh, Twitchell arrives and legally ties up all of Buck's property, which includes the ponies the kids were going to ride in the rodeo and pay off the old homestead. But Twitchell is in a car wreck, and the kids save his life by taking him from under the car and rushing him to the hospital. Twitchell releases the ponies and the rodeo is held and enough money raised to pay off the mortgage. But Twitchell says the money is for them and he not only is going to retire the mortgage himself, he is going to build them a bigger and better Orphanage. While producer Leo J. McCarthy wrote the story, he and the two other writers chose to be uncredited also or, at least, PRC chose not to credit them. Aside from the riding ability of the kids---and they were good---this film is a good measurement of the talent level of Kansas City stock company players at the time, which also indicates that Kansas City was among the last to know that Vaudeville had died. But Victor Adamson and Robert J. Horner made worse films without leaving California. Not by much, though.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0034123/?ref_=sr_i_550,"['Leo J.

However, they only succeed in rear-ending the limousine and hooking bumpers. Later the same day, while testing their boat on a lake, Skimmer and Tommy are swamped by the wake of a Townsend ship. When they go to the nearby Townsend shipbuilding factory to complain, Skimmer discovers that the manager of the plant is his old friend, Ralph Andrews. Later that night at Cap'n Mike's cafe, Skimmer snubs his former girl friend, Grace Holman, a singer, and Tommy is offended by his rude manner. When Skimmer and Tommy later collide with Jane's boat during a race, they blame Jane for causing them to lose. Ralph then hires them to work at the plant, and their innovations help speed production. As Tommy falls in love with Grace, Skimmer falls for Jane, his resentment having turned to love. With Ralph and Jane's help, the owner of the Townsend factory decides to build a prototype torpedo boat based on Skimmer and Tommy's plans, but when Tommy marries Grace, Skimmer breaks off their friendship and ends their partnership. Skimmer continues working on the boat, and Jane is instrumental in getting the two men to reunite. When a test of the boat proves fatal to Tommy because Skimmer pushes the boat beyond its limitations, Skimmer ends his relationship with Jane and leaves town. A furious Jane decides to improve on the torpedo boat without Skimmer, who, meanwhile, gets an Eastern builder to construct a new version of the boat. Upon completion, Ralph arranges for the Navy to test Jane's new torpedo boat and everyone is surprised when Skimmer shows up as a competitor. As the tests begin, Skimmer sends Grace a note giving her full rights to the profits from his boat. Jane rides with Ralph as he tests the Townsend torpedo boat, but when a smokescreen blinds them, Skimmer abandons his boat to save Jane and Ralph, who are on a deadly collision course with a barge.

Hattie refuses to donate more money to the school, despite the pleas of the college's president, Professor Edgar Boggs. Determined to raise enough money for needed buildings, Edgar and the school's veterinarian, Dr. Hall, organize the students and turn the school into a summer vacation lodge called the ""Hi, Neighbor Lodge."" A better-equipped lodge across the lake threatens to monopolize the tourists until the kids hit upon a scheme involving a pen-pal Lonely Hearts club. The students write to the club's members, inviting them to come to the lodge to meet other single people. Soon business is booming, and only one more month's bookings are needed to raise all of the required funds. A newspaper story about the lodge and the club raises the ire of Hattie, who deems the proceedings inappropriate. She descends upon the lodge with her niece Dorothy, sister Vera and lawyer, Don Wilson, who is engaged to Dorothy. Hattie insists on reclaiming the school property and orders everyone to leave. Determined to thwart Hattie, some of the boys decide to trick her into staying. They arrange for Don to come into contact with some poison ivy that night, and the next morning, Dr. Hall diagnoses his rash as measles. A quarantine is ordered for one month, and Don is bundled off to bed. While Vera pursues Roy, one of the students, Dr. Hall and Dorothy spend time together and fall in love. Even Hattie discovers a touch of romance at the lodge when Edgar, who was her childhood sweetheart, tries to recapture the days of their youth. Everyone's good humor is destroyed, however, when Don sneaks out to a local hospital and learns that he does not have measles. He exposes Dr. Hall's deception, and an angry Hattie declares that the school will be shut. Dorothy tells Hattie that she is staying to marry Dr. Hall, but when he learns of Hattie's plans, Dr. Hall makes a deal with her that he will give up Dorothy if she will keep the school open for Edgar's sake. Dr. Hall breaks off his relationship with Dorothy, who then returns with her relatives to the city. Brokenhearted over Dr. Hall, Dorothy resumes her engagement to Don, but on the day of the wedding, Vera returns to the school and informs everyone of Dr. Hall and Hattie's pact. Edgar and the kids rush to Hattie's mansion and establish a picket line to protest her unfairness. Don and Dorothy call off their wedding, and Hattie finally accepts Edgar's comforting.
