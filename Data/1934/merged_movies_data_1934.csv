300. West of the Pecos,1934,1h 8m,Approved,7.3,24,,"After the Civil War, Colonel Lambeth returns to his country home in Georgia and is reunited with his daughter Terrill. Broke and with no immediate prospects, Lambeth and Terrill decide to sell their property and go West together to re-start their lives. Accompanied by their former slaves, Jonah and Mauree, Lambeth and Terrill start a caravan for Texas. After she is harassed severely by two lecherous gamblers in San Antonio, Terrill dons male clothing, while her father buys a herd of cattle with their savings. At the same time, Pecos Smith, a rowdy but honest cowboy working outside San Antonio, learns that fellow cowpunchers Sam and Breen Sawtell have been spreading rumors that he is a cattle rustler. Sure that the Sawtells are gossiping in an attempt to cover their own guilt, Pecos rides into San Antonio and confronts the brothers in a cantina. After Sam draws his pistol on him, Pecos kills Sam and another cohort and, with Terrill's unwilling help, escapes the cantina before Breen returns his fire. Later, while Lambeth drives his cattle west, Terrill and Pecos meet on the range, and Terrill hires the boastful Pecos as a hand. Although exasperated by Pecos' endless teasing, Terrill maintains her manly disguise and tries desperately to impress him with her masculine abilities. As the group nears the Pecos River, Breen and another rustler plot to steal Lambeth's cattle once the herd has crossed the river. While Pecos warns Lambeth about the fierce Comanche Indians who live near his just purchased ranch, Manuel Gomez, Lambeth's Mexican guide, spots Breen and warns Lambeth to be wary of rustlers. After Pecos confesses to Terrill his past with Breen, they reach the much-needed water of the Pecos River. Annoyed that Terrill refuses to undress and swim with him, Pecos tosses her from her horse as they lead the herd across the river. Terrill nearly drowns in the rushing water, and Pecos pulls her unconscious body to the river shore, where he discovers her true sex. Although Pecos keeps Terrill's secret, she fires him in a fury, and he eventually rejoins his two cohorts, Wes and Court. After the Lambeths settle into their new ranch, however, Pecos, who with Wes and Court has started his own modest cattle operation, learns that they are struggling financially and once again offers his services. Despite her love for Pecos, Terrill is unable to reveal her secret and fights with him when he shows interest in another woman. Impatient with Terrill, Pecos quits the ranch and, while Breen, who has stolen 150 steers from Lambeth, implicates him in town as a rustler, rides back to his own ranch. After Breen tells Lambeth that Pecos is the rustler, he and Lambeth ride to Pecos' ranch and catch Court and Wes burning off the brands from cattle that they had stolen back from Breen. During the ensuing confrontation, Pecos, who has abandoned Court and Wes in disgust, sees a group of Comanches descending on his ranch. While Pecos fights with the armed Indians, Breen flees in fear, leaving Lambeth to be shot in the chest. Sure that Lambeth is dead, Breen rushes to town and accuses Pecos of the killing as well as the rustling. When Breen shows up at the Lambeths' ranch with several men from town, however, Lambeth, who was only wounded, exposes Breen's lies and vindicates Pecos. Cornered, Breen escapes but is thrown from his horse and is trampled to death. Thus freed from his past, Pecos happily embraces Terrill, who reveals at last her true feminine form.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0025971/?ref_=sr_i_300,"['Zane Grey', 'Milton Krims', 'John Twist']",['Phil Rosen'],"['Richard Dix', 'Martha Sleeper', 'Samuel S.

Sheila leaves despondent, and back in New York, Tommy takes her to the Traill house to meet his father. Mr. Traill rejects Sheila as a potential marriage partner for his son because of her class. In a passionate speech, Sheila reveals her background and states her own ideas about class, that honesty and decency are more important than station. Sheila then refuses to marry Tommy until Mr. Traill asks her, as not to suffer the same fate as her parents. The couple breaks up, and two weeks later, Sheila meets Jerry at her hotel and accepts his offer of a job inducing rich men to gamble at the nightclub he runs. Two months later, Tommy enters the club drunk and accuses Sheila of seeing Jerry throughout their own romance. Angered by Tommy's appearance, Sheila lies that she intends to marry Jerry, but after Jerry and Tommy fight, Sheila brings an unconscious Tommy home to his father, who finally asks her to marry his son. She refuses at first, telling the elder Traill what she has now become, but he informs her that it doesn't matter anymore.

Because they have entered a sacred place, the men are sentenced to death, but are saved when they hear a woman's voice say that they are to be made blood brothers of the Dyaks. Later, they see the young white woman who is treated as a goddess by the tribe. She and Tom are attracted to each other and she dances a native dance for him. After her dance, she relates her background: After emigrating from Russia to Borneo, her mother and father start a small rubber plantation. The happiness of the young family is shattered one afternoon when a cruel planter named Slade kidnaps her mother. When her father comes to his wife's aid, Slade and his native workers kill him, then take the wife and the little girl, Ileana, to Slade's house. After being raped repeatedly by Slade, the woman becomes deranged. Slade eventually lets her run away, followed by little Ileana, and the two find refuge in the jungle. The deranged mother spends her time plotting revenge and begins to realize her dream when she sees a native snake charmer. She then spends days making a flute and charming the jungle animals with her tune. Her music provokes the beasts of the jungle to kill Slade's men, and eventually the planter himself. Ileana then tells Tom that after Slade's death, she and her mother were adopted by the tribe. Her deranged mother still lives with her. When it is time for Tom and Sandy to leave, Tom asks Ileana to accompany them, but she does not want to leave her mother, who would be unable to live in civilization. Just before the boat leaves, a fire breaks out in the village and Ileana's mother is trapped and burned to death.

On their voyage home, Lucille complains to Emmie that her good-natured, though boring, Midwestern husband is no match for the charming and sophisticated Ronald, whom she left behind.

As Charles and Ronald get to know each other, however, they become fast friends and get drunk on a fishing expedition. In their drunken chatter, Ronald admits to Charles that Lucille does not look as glamorous to him in America as she did in Europe, and confesses that he is really too selfish to love a woman the same way Charles does. Meanwhile, Peggy's heart softens about her mother's love for Hippy, and she realizes Emmie is truly happy with him.

Back in his chambers, a solicitor named Pope was waiting to see him. Pope's firm handled most of the important legal cases. Pope was there to ask Sir Douglas to take up the defense of his client, Leslie Locke. Sir Douglas's mind went back some twenty years when he was struggling for recognition, and he had been in love with a very beautiful girl ---Laura Hyde. Sir Douglas had never spoken of his love, however, because he was very poor, and wanted to be quite certain, before he married, that he would be able to give his wife every luxury. Another admirer of Laura at the time was a well-to-do, volatile and impetuous young artist who, before the plodding Rolls knew what was happening, had swept Laura off her feet and married her. The artist's name was Leslie Locke. Sir Douglas had never gotten over his love for Laura and had never taken any interest in any other woman since, and he and Laura had remained the closest of friends. Pope's client, charged with murder of a model he had been seeing, and going on trial for his life, was the man who had married Rolls' only-love. Sir Douglas, knowing it may kill him, takes the case, and fights with the last of his strength to save the life of the husband of the woman he has always loved.

Jim cajoles True into wanting to experience love, hate and suffering, and convinces her to accompany him to New York. In Greenwich Village, True enjoys Jim's Bohemian friends, all of whom patronize the Pig's Eye cafe: unpublished poet Saracen Jones; struggling artist Russell Storm; and dancer Vavara, with whom, unknown to True, Jim is involved. When the group, who all live in Russell's apartment, are evicted, Jim, who is really an agitator for mercenary reasons, conducts a sidewalk auction of Russell's paintings, which turns into a brawl due to Jim's inflammatory criticisms of society. True slaps wealthy dilettante Michael Harrison after he facetiously offers to buy a painting just to destroy it, and she is sentenced to ten days in jail, as is Jim. Later, Michael apologizes to True and, after calling her friends phonies, invites her to meet successful artists and writers. When True argues that her friends have not had the opportunities that Michael's friends have had, Michael proposes a deal: he will pay the expenses of her friends for six months, and if even one makes good or shows gratitude, he will buy True a drink; however, if they all fail, she will have an obligation to him. True agrees and writes a novel entitled I Believed in You . The others, however, squander their money. When they demand more, True explodes and calls them fakers. Still believing in Jim, she then overhears him tell another woman the same things he once told her. She walks disillusioned throughout the city and onto a bridge, but after hearing voices from the past, she gains new confidence and visits the publishers Lang and Long, who sign her to a contract. True then gives Michael her royalty check as her first repayment.
