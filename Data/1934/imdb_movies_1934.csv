Accompanied by their former slaves, Jonah and Mauree, Lambeth and Terrill start a caravan for Texas. After she is harassed severely by two lecherous gamblers in San Antonio, Terrill dons male clothing, while her father buys a herd of cattle with their savings. At the same time, Pecos Smith, a rowdy but honest cowboy working outside San Antonio, learns that fellow cowpunchers Sam and Breen Sawtell have been spreading rumors that he is a cattle rustler. Sure that the Sawtells are gossiping in an attempt to cover their own guilt, Pecos rides into San Antonio and confronts the brothers in a cantina. After Sam draws his pistol on him, Pecos kills Sam and another cohort and, with Terrill's unwilling help, escapes the cantina before Breen returns his fire. Later, while Lambeth drives his cattle west, Terrill and Pecos meet on the range, and Terrill hires the boastful Pecos as a hand. Although exasperated by Pecos' endless teasing, Terrill maintains her manly disguise and tries desperately to impress him with her masculine abilities. As the group nears the Pecos River, Breen and another rustler plot to steal Lambeth's cattle once the herd has crossed the river. While Pecos warns Lambeth about the fierce Comanche Indians who live near his just purchased ranch, Manuel Gomez, Lambeth's Mexican guide, spots Breen and warns Lambeth to be wary of rustlers. After Pecos confesses to Terrill his past with Breen, they reach the much-needed water of the Pecos River. Annoyed that Terrill refuses to undress and swim with him, Pecos tosses her from her horse as they lead the herd across the river. Terrill nearly drowns in the rushing water, and Pecos pulls her unconscious body to the river shore, where he discovers her true sex. Although Pecos keeps Terrill's secret, she fires him in a fury, and he eventually rejoins his two cohorts, Wes and Court. After the Lambeths settle into their new ranch, however, Pecos, who with Wes and Court has started his own modest cattle operation, learns that they are struggling financially and once again offers his services. Despite her love for Pecos, Terrill is unable to reveal her secret and fights with him when he shows interest in another woman. Impatient with Terrill, Pecos quits the ranch and, while Breen, who has stolen 150 steers from Lambeth, implicates him in town as a rustler, rides back to his own ranch. After Breen tells Lambeth that Pecos is the rustler, he and Lambeth ride to Pecos' ranch and catch Court and Wes burning off the brands from cattle that they had stolen back from Breen. During the ensuing confrontation, Pecos, who has abandoned Court and Wes in disgust, sees a group of Comanches descending on his ranch. While Pecos fights with the armed Indians, Breen flees in fear, leaving Lambeth to be shot in the chest. Sure that Lambeth is dead, Breen rushes to town and accuses Pecos of the killing as well as the rustling. When Breen shows up at the Lambeths' ranch with several men from town, however, Lambeth, who was only wounded, exposes Breen's lies and vindicates Pecos.

Back in his chambers, a solicitor named Pope was waiting to see him. Pope's firm handled most of the important legal cases. Pope was there to ask Sir Douglas to take up the defense of his client, Leslie Locke. Sir Douglas's mind went back some twenty years when he was struggling for recognition, and he had been in love with a very beautiful girl ---Laura Hyde. Sir Douglas had never spoken of his love, however, because he was very poor, and wanted to be quite certain, before he married, that he would be able to give his wife every luxury. Another admirer of Laura at the time was a well-to-do, volatile and impetuous young artist who, before the plodding Rolls knew what was happening, had swept Laura off her feet and married her. The artist's name was Leslie Locke. Sir Douglas had never gotten over his love for Laura and had never taken any interest in any other woman since, and he and Laura had remained the closest of friends. Pope's client, charged with murder of a model he had been seeing, and going on trial for his life, was the man who had married Rolls' only-love. Sir Douglas, knowing it may kill him, takes the case, and fights with the last of his strength to save the life of the husband of the woman he has always loved.
