When a decree is issued that no more Americans may enter Texas, William H. Wharton, fiery head of a faction determined on independence or nothing, warns Stephen F. Austin that the time for half-measures is past. Austin, responsible for bringing the Americans to Texas as colonists, reminds Wharton that a settler's revolt against Mexico would dishonor his name and the arrangements he had with the Mexican government. He gets the ""Whartonites"" to agree to a general convention of all colonists. Almerian Dickinson, biggest land owner in the settlement of Gonzales, deeply in love with his wife Anne, warns Wharton that a bloody revolt would endanger every wife and mother in the colony. He proposes they send Austin to Mexico City to ask Santa Anna to grant Texans a voice in their own government. After months in Mexico City of waiting to see Santa Anna, Austin is granted a mock interview and then arrested and thrown into a dungeon. In Texas, the months pass with no news from Austin and Wharton goes to work in earnest in early 1835 to fan the fires of revolution. Santa Anna decides to march troops north and finish off the rebel ""gringos"" - a description that only came later in the conflict - once and for all, and frees Austin to serve as an example. The Texans, under Dickinson and William Barrett Travis, send the advance Mexican troops back across the border in retreat. Austin goes for help from the United States, and the Texans fortify themselves at the old Alamo mission in Bejar with Travis in command. And one February morning, his scouts bring news that Santa Anna is coming with an army of 5,000 men. Anne Dickinson takes her baby, rides for Bejar (San Antonio), slips through the Mexican lines and joins her husband in the beleaguered fort to his mingled joy and horror.

During what appears to be a normal transaction, Jimmy gives Ruth $100,000 that he has taken from the vault, and after they hide the money in a music box, which they mail to Ruth's Uncle Billy for safekeeping, they turn themselves in. Mike Roberts, a detective for the bank's insurance company, tries to convince them to lighten their sentence by returning the money, but they consider the money rightfully theirs and refuse. The judge hearing their case is dismayed by their lack of repentance, and sentences them to one-to-ten years without parole. Jimmy and Ruth are then sent to separate prisons, but communicate by notes. Jimmy's tough cellmate, Blackie Clayton, tries to find out where the money is hidden, but Jimmy gives him misleading information. Sometime later, Roberts arranges for Jimmy and Ruth's paroles and attaches special stipulations that he hopes will make them go straight. The couple are paroled under the conditions that they have no civil rights and cannot marry for eight years. They are crushed by the conditions, but will not give in when Roberts tells them they will be free if they return the money. They try to retrieve the music box from Uncle Billy, but they discover that he has died and that his possessions are to be auctioned. They go to the auction, where they are outbid by auction aficionado Victor J. Holbrook, after which they go to Holbrook's apartment and explain that they need the box. Holbrook tells them he has already sent the box to his aunt, Martha Foster, and when Ruth and Jimmy return to their boardinghouse, they find Blackie waiting for them. He orders them to cut him in on the stolen money, but when Roberts appears, Blackie sneaks out after stealing their money and car. Jimmy and Ruth hop a train to Sunnydale, where Martha lives, and although they are detained by sheriff Ira Foster, Martha's husband, until they show their parole papers, they find Martha's guest farm, check in and locate the music box. After dinner, Roberts, alerted by Ira, shows up to warn Jimmy and Ruth that Blackie is close on their trail. Later that night, Blackie threatens Ruth that he will kill Jimmy unless she gives him the money. Jimmy and Ruth attempt to elude Blackie, but he soon catches up with them and fights with Jimmy.

He has been diligently experimenting to find a cure for polio and neglects his fiance because of this. When he and other physicians refuse to operate on a young woman because her physician is late in arriving, nurse Ruth Hanlon accuses Dan, Dr. Ellery Stanwood and Dr. Anson Ludlow of negligence, even though she knows it is against medical ethics to take over another doctor's case without his permission. Dan is forced to fire Ruth because of her outspokenness, but she leaves on friendly terms with him, and he records her parting words in his diary. One day, family doctor Clem Driscoll brings in a charity case, Michael Fielding, an eleven-year-old boy, who has a gift for playing the violin. Dan makes the initial diagnosis, and the case is taken by Ludlow. Ludlow is called away to treat a wealthy patron of the hospital the day that Michael is scheduled for surgery, and although Dan believes that the boy will suffer if the surgery is postponed, he does not interfere. Before he leaves the hospital to join Catherine at the opera one night, he sees the patient over whom Ruth lost her job wheeled out of her room, dead, and goes to visit Ruth at her manicurist job. She is touched by his concern. Three days later, Michael goes into surgery, but the infection has spread too far, and he loses the use of his arm. Mrs. Fielding files suit against Ludlow and the hospital for criminal negligence, and Dan loses his job because he agrees to testify on her behalf. As Dan reluctantly packs up his office and leaves his research lab, Catherine announces that she will leave him if he does not change his position, but, already a little drunk, he does not budge. He arrives at Ruth's apartment completely drunk, and vowing his love for her, falls asleep on the couch. Ruth and Dan go to work with Driscoll, who is inundated with cases of infantile paralysis, or poliomyelitis, as an epidemic sweeps the city. Frustrated by his inability to truly help the children, Dan begs local hospitals to allow him to continue his research for a cure, but he is refused. Desperate, he agrees to testify on behalf of the hospital when Stanwood offers to reopen his position. During the trial, Mrs. Fielding becomes overwrought when she hears Dan's testimony, and grabbing a policeman's gun, shoots Dan. Catherine returns to Dan, but in a stupor from his operation, Dan calls out Ruth's name, and Catherine leaves. Dan recovers from his injury and returns to work, as does Ruth, whom he has married. His latest entry in his diary is that Ludlow operated on Michael Fielding with complete success.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0028793/?ref_=sr_i_295,"['Joseph Anthony', 'Samuel Ornitz', 'David Boehm']",['Charles Vidor'],"['George Bancroft', 'Helen Burgess', 'John Trent', 'Ruth Coleman', 'Ronald Sinclair', 'Molly Lamont', 'Sidney Blackmer', 'Charles Waldron', 'Frank Puglia', 'Milburn Stone']",,,,,"February 16, 1937",['United States'],"['Paramount Studios - 5555 Melrose Avenue, Hollywood, Los Angeles, California, USA (Studio)']",['Paramount Pictures'],,"['Drama', 'Romance']",['English']

Hollywood Round-Up,1937,54m,Approved,6.1,114,,"One of three films made by Columbia circa 1936-37 based on behind-the-scenes film making with a ""western"" setting (""The Cowboy Star"", ""Hollywood Round-up"" and ""It Happened in Hollywood""), plus RKO weighed in the same year with George O'Brien's ""Hollywood Cowboy."" It had been done before, RKO's 1933 ""Scarlet River"", and would be done again, ""Shooting High"" from 20th Century-Fox and Republic's ""Bells of Rosarita"", among others with a western setting, but this Coronet production with Buck Jones may well be the best of the lot as it devotes more footage to actual film-making both on studio sets and locations. One out-of-the norm plot incident has the studio head Lew Wallace offering a job to a fading star Carol Stevens, with a semi-apology for casting her in what he calls an ""outdoor special"" and she calls a ""horse opry"", and this scene in a B-western leaves no doubt that the B-western and it people were near the bottom of Hollywood's pecking order. The stereotypes are there, with Shemp Howard's over-zealous ""assistant director"" (who does calm down and gets more real when he loses his whistle), the ego-ridden ""star"" in Grant Drexel, and the deserving-to-be-the-star relegated to stand-in and stunts Buck Kennedy, but the remaining crew and player roles are realistic (especially the real stuntmen playing stuntmen). Buck Kennedy is the stand-in and double for star Grant Drexel and is fired when he has a fight with the bullying Drexel over Drexel's treatment of leading lady Carol Stephens. The movie company is on location, and a group of gangsters led by Eddie Kane and Lester Dorr, posing as another movie company, come to the location town and talk the banker into letting them film a fake holdup in his bank, but the holdup is real and the out-of-work Buck, whom they hire as the fall guy to cover their getaway, is left holding the bag and jailed by town sheriff Slim Whitaker. Things get worse for Buck before they get better. A mid-point sequence has hotel clerk George A. Beranger, who dreams of being a western star, performing a twittering, ballet-slippering audition for the checking-in film company by quoting lines from a western and asking them to identify the film.

Agatha and Prudence, with Jerry in tow, arrive at the school, and shortly after, Agatha is crushed to find out that Bruce Arnold, a newcomer, has been given the job. Bruce suggests that Agatha should retire, saying that she is too old and inflexible. The other teachers, including new teacher Ellen Southard, a former student of Agatha, are upset about Bruce's appointment, but Agatha vows to keep teaching as she has always done. Some time later, Jerry is stealing some canned food when her classmate, Elliot ""Wet Mouth"" Braxton, bumps into her and is mistaken for the thief by store owner Nicky Zackorackus. Elliot is captured, but Jerry confesses and explains that she needed the food for her troubled family. Ellen convinces Bruce to help Jerry by telling him that she was also a troublemaker as a youngster, and was saved from a disreputable life by Agatha's attentions. Agatha convinces Sergeant Abbot, also a former pupil, not to arrest Jerry, while Prudence asks school janitor Guili, a friend of Zackorackus, to dissuade the store owner from pressing charges. Everything is settled satisfactorily, and all seems well until one afternoon, as the children are playing in the street after school, a speeding truck injures Jerry after she bravely pushes another child out of its way. Agatha and Prudence organize the local mothers into blockading the street so that the children can play safely, and despite initial interference from the police, the street is designated as a school play area. Later, on the night before a big exam, Elliot is stealing the answers to the test questions when he overhears Bruce and Ellen, who have fallen in love, teasing each other about her terrible past. Elliot falls as he climbs through a transom while trying to escape, and is found by Agatha and Prudence. He tells them that he saw Bruce and Ellen kissing, and misinterprets their joking to mean that Bruce cannot marry Ellen because of her past. Agatha slaps the boy for slandering the couple, then apologizes. Elliot returns home, where his mother becomes hysterical when she sees his injuries from the fall. He lies to her, telling her that Agatha abused him, so she will not know that he was trying to cheat. Mrs. Braxton presses charges against Agatha, and she is temporarily suspended from duty until her hearing before the school board. Agatha refuses to defend herself, but a few hours before the hearing, her loyal students ask prominent community members, such as banker Philip Pierpont, actress Ethel Harriman and boxing champion Max Handler, to attend the hearing and defend their former teacher.

In Texas, Lucky wins enough money in roulette to lease a parcel of land, and he and his friend ""Smiley"" begin drilling. Julia Frayne, whom Lucky met while gambling, turns out to be the daughter of oil tycoon Tom Frayne, who is eager to buy out the leases of the growing number of independent drillers, called ""wildcatters,"" in order to hold a monopoly on the local oil fields. When he runs out of money, Lucky ""shoots"" his well, trying to force the oil up using explosives, but gets only smoke. Julia then hires Lucky to drill her lease, thereby abandoning his own. She hopes Lucky's friends will follow his example and, seeing the futility of their drilling, sell to Frayne Oil Company. Helen, meanwhile, visits and gets a job at a beauty shop, while Lucky spends his nights out on the town with Julia, believing he is winning favor with Frayne. When the papers announce that Frayne is withdrawing from the area, the land values recede, and most of the wildcatters abandon their leases, which Frayne then buys at a bargain. Lucky and his crews work diligently and strike oil too early, however, and Frayne fails to retrieve the leases of those wildcatters who have held out. All those who hold leases are now forced to work twenty-four hours a day, lest their leases expire before they have struck oil. Lucky's crews, meanwhile, are angry at him for betraying them and spending his nights with Julia. One night, Frayne orders Julia to keep Lucky occupied at nightclubs while Frayne's men sabotage the wildcatters' rigs. In the morning, the wildcatters prepare to lynch Lucky, unaware that his wells are really Frayne's. Smiley and Helen promise the men that Lucky will be able to clear himself in an hour. Lucky, meanwhile, goes to Frayne, who bought the wildcat leases the day before and is planning to foreclose them today, and threatens him unless he fixes the rigs. Lucky then goes out to the fields, and the men mob him and Smiley. They are about to lynch them, when Lucky's friend Johnson, who was going to kill Lucky himself until he learned the truth, arrives and tells the men they can save their rigs if they get them working by the next day. The sheriff then arrives with Frayne, and Lucky tells him all his wells are rigged to be shot. As Lucky had been drilling past an underground waterfall, he warns Frayne that if he shoots the wells, he will get only water, not oil. Frayne gives in, offering Lucky a permanent position with him, but Lucky accepts Johnson's offer to become his partner. Helen then reveals that she has already sold their gas station and has $3,000 to put toward working capital for Johnson's rig. Lucky finally realizes what a heel he has been and how swell his wife is.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0029780/?ref_=sr_i_565,"['Charles Logue', 'Tom Van Dycke']",['Lewis D.

Nicky is convicted and sentenced to execution, but refuses to tell his wife what really happened. She hires attorney Horace Darwin to get an appeal, but Darwin drops the case under pressure from Ice. On the night of the execution, Ice, who has introduced himself to Gail as a friend of Nicky's, Gail and newspaper reporter Joe Flynn, who is on Gail's side, head to the prison but are delayed by massive flooding. They are forced to leave the bus and join thousands of refugees at a Red Cross center. The onslaught of rain and floods causes the prison to delay Nicky's execution and transfer him to another prison, but the car he is traveling in is washed away. His guard, who arrives at the center badly hurt, believes Nicky drowned, and Flynn spreads the news, but Gail finds Nicky unconscious on a nearby cot. She desperately steals a Red Cross armband and impersonates a nurse, then hires a flamboyant magician and his wife, Richard and Mimi Candle, to transport her and Nicky away from the refugee center in their trailer. Gail narrowly avoids the company of Ice on her trip, but he becomes wise to her scheme, and he and Flynn follow in pursuit. The Candles are forced to stop at a mansion, Fentridge Hall, because of severe flooding. Colonel Fentridge and his spinster sister Belinda graciously provide accommodations for the group.
