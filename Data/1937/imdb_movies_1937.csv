Dan is forced to fire Ruth because of her outspokenness, but she leaves on friendly terms with him, and he records her parting words in his diary. One day, family doctor Clem Driscoll brings in a charity case, Michael Fielding, an eleven-year-old boy, who has a gift for playing the violin. Dan makes the initial diagnosis, and the case is taken by Ludlow. Ludlow is called away to treat a wealthy patron of the hospital the day that Michael is scheduled for surgery, and although Dan believes that the boy will suffer if the surgery is postponed, he does not interfere. Before he leaves the hospital to join Catherine at the opera one night, he sees the patient over whom Ruth lost her job wheeled out of her room, dead, and goes to visit Ruth at her manicurist job. She is touched by his concern. Three days later, Michael goes into surgery, but the infection has spread too far, and he loses the use of his arm. Mrs. Fielding files suit against Ludlow and the hospital for criminal negligence, and Dan loses his job because he agrees to testify on her behalf. As Dan reluctantly packs up his office and leaves his research lab, Catherine announces that she will leave him if he does not change his position, but, already a little drunk, he does not budge.

During the trial, Mrs. Fielding becomes overwrought when she hears Dan's testimony, and grabbing a policeman's gun, shoots Dan.

389. Hollywood Round-Up,1937,54m,Approved,6.1,114,,"One of three films made by Columbia circa 1936-37 based on behind-the-scenes film making with a ""western"" setting (""The Cowboy Star"", ""Hollywood Round-up"" and ""It Happened in Hollywood""), plus RKO weighed in the same year with George O'Brien's ""Hollywood Cowboy."" It had been done before, RKO's 1933 ""Scarlet River"", and would be done again, ""Shooting High"" from 20th Century-Fox and Republic's ""Bells of Rosarita"", among others with a western setting, but this Coronet production with Buck Jones may well be the best of the lot as it devotes more footage to actual film-making both on studio sets and locations. One out-of-the norm plot incident has the studio head Lew Wallace offering a job to a fading star Carol Stevens, with a semi-apology for casting her in what he calls an ""outdoor special"" and she calls a ""horse opry"", and this scene in a B-western leaves no doubt that the B-western and it people were near the bottom of Hollywood's pecking order. The stereotypes are there, with Shemp Howard's over-zealous ""assistant director"" (who does calm down and gets more real when he loses his whistle), the ego-ridden ""star"" in Grant Drexel, and the deserving-to-be-the-star relegated to stand-in and stunts Buck Kennedy, but the remaining crew and player roles are realistic (especially the real stuntmen playing stuntmen). Buck Kennedy is the stand-in and double for star Grant Drexel and is fired when he has a fight with the bullying Drexel over Drexel's treatment of leading lady Carol Stephens. The movie company is on location, and a group of gangsters led by Eddie Kane and Lester Dorr, posing as another movie company, come to the location town and talk the banker into letting them film a fake holdup in his bank, but the holdup is real and the out-of-work Buck, whom they hire as the fall guy to cover their getaway, is left holding the bag and jailed by town sheriff Slim Whitaker. Things get worse for Buck before they get better. A mid-point sequence has hotel clerk George A. Beranger, who dreams of being a western star, performing a twittering, ballet-slippering audition for the checking-in film company by quoting lines from a western and asking them to identify the film. Shemp Howard guesses ""Little Women.""",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0029011/?ref_=sr_i_389

Julia Frayne, whom Lucky met while gambling, turns out to be the daughter of oil tycoon Tom Frayne, who is eager to buy out the leases of the growing number of independent drillers, called ""wildcatters,"" in order to hold a monopoly on the local oil fields. When he runs out of money, Lucky ""shoots"" his well, trying to force the oil up using explosives, but gets only smoke. Julia then hires Lucky to drill her lease, thereby abandoning his own. She hopes Lucky's friends will follow his example and, seeing the futility of their drilling, sell to Frayne Oil Company. Helen, meanwhile, visits and gets a job at a beauty shop, while Lucky spends his nights out on the town with Julia, believing he is winning favor with Frayne.

Lucky's crews, meanwhile, are angry at him for betraying them and spending his nights with Julia. One night, Frayne orders Julia to keep Lucky occupied at nightclubs while Frayne's men sabotage the wildcatters' rigs. In the morning, the wildcatters prepare to lynch Lucky, unaware that his wells are really Frayne's. Smiley and Helen promise the men that Lucky will be able to clear himself in an hour.
