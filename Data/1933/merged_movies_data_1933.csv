When a woman denounces Kingfish as a faker, Smiley, identifying himself as a medical inspector, conducts Kingfish safely through the angry crowd and grabs Lynn's purse on the way out. Later, on a train, Smiley meets Lynn again, and after he returns the purse, she explains that she is traveling to find the trail of three swindlers who talked her brother, a bank officer, into investing $20,000 belonging to an estate he was handling, and then left with the money. Two of the crooks, a couple named Sandburg, are in New Orleans, while the other, Hubert Wayne, is promoting a new show in New York. Smiley offers to help after privately convincing his cohorts that once they ""cheat the cheaters,"" they will keep the money themselves. In a New Orleans hotel, Kingfish, masquerading as a philandering Texas oilman, attracts the interest of the Sandburgs, who plan to trap him in a compromising position and then blackmail him. After a fight, however, Kingfish, Smiley and the others get away with the Sandburgs' half of the swindle, $10,000, and proceed to New York where Lynn, posing as a chorus girl, has provoked Wayne's advances. When she introduces Wayne to Kingfish, who this time masquerades as a British jam manufacturer, Wayne, planning to swindle Kingfish, persuades him to invest $10,000 in the show to match his own $10,000, which gangster Tommy Monk fronts for the swindle. Wayne then plans to appropriate Kingfish's money through a switch of envelopes. Suspecting the ruse, Smiley trains Kingfish to do his own envelope switch. Kingfish's switch works, but after Smiley leaves with the $20,000, Wayne and Tommy discover the trick and capture Lynn and Kingfish, who reveals, to Lynn's dismay, Smiley's plan to keep the money. Tommy takes over the show to make back his money and coerces stage stars Ned Flynn, Jimmy Dante and female impersonator Ray Best to perform. On opening night, Smiley is captured at the theater, but he is able to call Tommy's rival, Rags Rigby. By imitating Tommy's voice, Smiley dares Rigby to come to the show. Rigby and his men respond to the challenge and start a massive fight in the theater. Smiley rescues Lynn and later, on another train, after he learns that Lynn did not trust him, upbraids her and reveals that he sent the money to her brother. The other three cohorts then decide to go straight. After planting her purse in Smiley's pocket, Lynn playfully accuses him of robbing her and they embrace.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0023764/?ref_=sr_i_73,"['William M.

After helping the man scramble onto the train, Looney opens a violin case to reveal grenades, which he and the man, Tom Daley, throw at the pursuers, who soon retreat. Impressed when Tom says he that he is known as ""El Diablo,"" Looney offers to introduce him to his gang, but Tom is not interested. At the border, customs officer Pedro Gonzales learns that Tom, an American, broke up a wedding and stole the bride. He gathers an army of men and boards the train looking for Tom, who hides in the upper berth of a vacant room. Patricia Carter then enters and, after she tells Gonzales that she is alone, begins to remove her clothing until Tom knocks over a bag. When she screams, Tom puts his hand over her mouth and forces her to listen as he explains that the bride was being forced to marry a man she didn't love and that she was ""stolen"" with her own consent. After Gonzales and his men leave the train, Tom jumps off the train and rides into Delhi, Arizona, where he tells his old pal, Newt Olsen, that his uncle, Jerry Malone, sent him a letter urging him to take over his ranch, which is the largest in the state. After Newt's ornery wife Sally, angry that Newt is drunk and with Tom, fires a rifle at them, they ride to the Malone ranch. At the ranch, Malone has died, supposedly by accident, and John Ross, Malone's attorney and the leader of Looney's gang, plans to have Frank Briggs, one of his men, pose as Tom so that they can inherit the ranch and then start a Ranchers' and Cattlemen's Protective Association. Pat, an undercover agent who is traveling with Ross, secretly attempts to transmit this information via a radio in her bedroom. When Ross tries to act romantic, she shies away, but promises to go away with him as soon as their work in setting up the association is over. Tom and Newt ride up and learn from a servant that Malone has died. After Tom saves Looney from an irate bull, whom he tried to rope, Looney introduces Tom and Newt, whom he calls ""Killer Olsen,"" to the gang. Tom says that he wants to muscle in on their scheme. Ross then sends his men to kill them at night, but Tom and Newt capture the men and lock them in an ice-house. The next morning, Ross capitulates and suggests that Tom pose as Tom Daley and that Pat pose as his wife, so that if Tom meets with an ""accident"" or double-crosses them, his ""widow"" will get the ranch. They go to Judge Wilson's home, where the will is to be probated, but the judge is out of town until the morning. Mrs. Wilson, who, it turns out, is Tom's godmother, insists that he and Pat stay the night, to Ross's and Pat's discomfort. Alone together that night, Pat grows fond of Tom and encourages him to pull out of the scheme, while he remarks that she does not belong with the gang. Tom spends the night in the room sleeping on a chair. The next day, as the will is settled, Looney and Newt get drunk and become pals, but Sally shows up, and after she reveals Tom's identity, the gang captures her and Newt. Pat is relieved when she learns the truth about Tom. After Tom is knocked out, Pat tries to call the police on her radio, but Ross catches her and smashes it. He tells his gang to kill the Olsens and Tom. Tom convinces Looney to help ""the killer"" and his wife escape. Newt, however, refuses to leave Tom, who fights the gangsters with Newt's and Looney's help. After Briggs shoots Looney, the police arrive, and Ross is shot trying to escape. Although Looney tells Newt that he is ""hitting the last trail,"" Newt points out that Looney's belt stopped the bullet. Sally calls her husband a brave hero and promises never to scold him again. Tom kisses Pat and reminds her that according to the deed they filed when they pretended to be married, half of the ranch is hers.

What he doesn't know is that his out-of-work father is about to be arrested for theft and is sending him away so he won't be there for the upcoming disgrace. ""Scooter"" expects to be greeted by ""Dobe"" and his wife, Eleanor, but is met only by ""Dobe"" and isn't responsive to ""Scooter's"" questions about his missing wife. ""Dobe"" has problems of his own and is about to send Scooter back to Chicago, when he gets a telegram informing him that Bill O'Neal has committed suicide. Knowing that Scooter will be put in an orphanage, he decides to keep the kid with him. After several nights of camping out, ""Scooter"" can't understand why they never reach ""Dobe's"" ranch, until two cowhands tell him that ""Dobe"" is a restless and relentless man always on the search for his wife and the man, Jim Weston, with whom she ran away. ""Dobe"" learns where the pair are hiding but ""Scooter"" gets to town first and warns them. ""Dobe"", robbed of his chance for vengeance, takes it out on ""Scooter"" and blurts out the truth about his father's death. Then, touched by pity and ""Scooter's"" grief, ""Dobe"" decides to enter a rodeo to earn enough money to buy Scooter a silver-mounted saddle. But, in the bull-dogging event, ""Dobe"" spots Eleanor and Jim in the grandstand, and this diverts his attention-to-business-at-hand enough that he ends up getting gored by the steer he was trying to dog. While recovering, he learns the whereabouts of his cheating wife and her new best-friend, but also realizes that the future of ""Scooter"" means more to him than his quest for vengeance. He rides forth to tell them all-is-forgiven but Scooter thinks he has other intentions and follows him. ""Dobe"" confronts Eleanor and Jim but, Jim, fearing it is a ruse, pulls a gun. Shots ring out, ""Dobe"" kills Jim but a stray bullet hits ""Scooter."" Eleanor goes for the Marshal, while ""Dobe"", carrying Scooter, races furiously to the doctor's office.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0025416/?ref_=sr_i_354,"['Paul Sloane', 'Agnes Brand Leahy', 'Bobby Vernon']",['Paul Sloane'],"['Jackie Cooper', 'Lila Lee', 'Addison Richards', 'John Wray', 'Gavin Gordon', 'Barton MacLane', 'J.M.

Mrs. Van Aster, however, refuses to sell the painting to anyone locally because of a dispute with townspeople regarding damage to their property because of her fox hunt. Nash plans with reporter Tim Wilson, whose primary interest is flirting with women, a way to procure the painting. After Dutch cheese manufacturer Hugo Tannenberg, offers Mrs. Van Aster $100,000 for the painting, which he says he may use as a trademark for his cheeses, Tim goes to talk with befuddled art connoisseur Rendleby, a former curator at the Metropolitan Museum who now runs a curio shop in Asterville with his daughter Margaret. When Tim sees Margaret at the window of the shop, he immediately falls in love with her, and after paying an organ grinder to play a waltz, he dances with Margaret into the parlor. Rendleby, who is awed by the painting, readily agrees to intercede with Mrs. Van Aster. That night, a burglar, Joe Smiley, sneaks into the Rendleby shop. After Rendleby tells a police officer, who had been following Smiley, that Smiley is a guest, Smiley, in gratitude, gives Rendleby his address and offers his services anytime Rendleby needs them. Mrs. Van Aster refuses Rendleby's request that she keep the painting and sells it to Tannenberg. Margaret, when she learns this and sees Tim's elation, rebukes him. Rendleby then finds Smiley and arranges to go with him to steal the painting. Smiley, who, when casing the place, fell for the advances of Mrs. Van Aster's chambermaid Belle, cuts the painting out of its frame. As the police search for clues, Tim deduces from his conversation with Belle that Smiley is the culprit and tells the police sergeant, but then finds Rendleby admiring the painting at his shop. When Smiley, with the police in pursuit, comes to the shop, Tim hides the painting, but the police find it. Tim convinces them not to arrest Rendleby until Tannenberg identifies the painting and then instructs Tannenberg to claim that it is a fake.
