Als sie bei einer Modenschau Kleider vorf√ºhren darf, kommt sie auf die Idee, Mannequin zu werden. Aber ihre Eltern (Erika Dunkelmann und Erich Franz) sind damit nicht einverstanden. Eines Tages begleitet Uschi ihre Freundin nach Feierabend wieder mal in den Westsektor der Stadt. An einem Stand m√∂chte sie sich etwas zum Naschen kaufen. Der H√§ndler will zwar ihr Ostgeld annehmen, aber den Schein nicht wechseln. Das bekommt ein in der N√§he stehender junger Mann mit und bezahlt die Summe. ""Lord"" (Uwe-Jens Pape), seine lustige, unbek√ºmmerte Art und auch sein Kofferradio gefallen Uschi, und sie geht noch ein St√ºck mit ihm spazieren. Er und sein Freund Hans (Ulrich Thein) wohnen im Westsektor und verdienen ihr Geld mit dem Waschen von Luxuslimousinen. F√ºr Hans ist Uschi Liebe auf den ersten Blick. Als die Autow√§scherei eines Tages dicht macht und ""Lord"" Berlin verl√§sst, ergreift Hans seine Chance bei der jungen Frau. Mit seiner ruhigen, zuverl√§ssigen Art verzeichnet er bald Erfolge, und es entwickelt sich zwischen beiden eine zarte Liebe. Nach mehreren erfolglosen Versuchen findet er eine neue Arbeit bei einem Abbruchunternehmen. Er ermutigt Uschi, sich bei einer Mannequinschule anzumelden und √ºbernimmt die Kosten. Sie verbringen sehr viel Zeit miteinander, und eines Tages, w√§hrend eines starken Regens, geht Hans mit ihr in die Wohnung eines Freundes. Uschi vermutet, dass es seine ist, doch auch er wohnt noch bei seiner Mutter (Marga Legal). Da Uschi immer √∂fter sp√§t nach Hause kommt, gibt es √Ñrger mit ihren Eltern. Nach einem heftigen Streit beschlie√üt sie, zu Hans zu ziehen. Doch in seiner vermeintlichen Wohnung √∂ffnet eine junge Frau, die ihr erkl√§rt, dass Hans gar nicht hier wohnt. Mit einem Hoffnungsschimmer f√ºr eine gemeinsame Zukunft endet die Liebesgeschichte zweier junger Menschen - einem M√§dchen aus Ostberlin und einem jungen Mann aus dem Westsektor der Stadt. Die noch vor dem Mauerbau entstandene Kom√∂die steht in ihrer unpathetischen Romantik dem italienischen Neorealismus nahe und ist ein hochinteressantes Zeitdokument.
