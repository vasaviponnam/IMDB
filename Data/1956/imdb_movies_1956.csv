Als sie bei einer Modenschau Kleider vorführen darf, kommt sie auf die Idee, Mannequin zu werden. Aber ihre Eltern (Erika Dunkelmann und Erich Franz) sind damit nicht einverstanden. Eines Tages begleitet Uschi ihre Freundin nach Feierabend wieder mal in den Westsektor der Stadt. An einem Stand möchte sie sich etwas zum Naschen kaufen. Der Händler will zwar ihr Ostgeld annehmen, aber den Schein nicht wechseln. Das bekommt ein in der Nähe stehender junger Mann mit und bezahlt die Summe. ""Lord"" (Uwe-Jens Pape), seine lustige, unbekümmerte Art und auch sein Kofferradio gefallen Uschi, und sie geht noch ein Stück mit ihm spazieren. Er und sein Freund Hans (Ulrich Thein) wohnen im Westsektor und verdienen ihr Geld mit dem Waschen von Luxuslimousinen. Für Hans ist Uschi Liebe auf den ersten Blick. Als die Autowäscherei eines Tages dicht macht und ""Lord"" Berlin verlässt, ergreift Hans seine Chance bei der jungen Frau. Mit seiner ruhigen, zuverlässigen Art verzeichnet er bald Erfolge, und es entwickelt sich zwischen beiden eine zarte Liebe. Nach mehreren erfolglosen Versuchen findet er eine neue Arbeit bei einem Abbruchunternehmen. Er ermutigt Uschi, sich bei einer Mannequinschule anzumelden und übernimmt die Kosten. Sie verbringen sehr viel Zeit miteinander, und eines Tages, während eines starken Regens, geht Hans mit ihr in die Wohnung eines Freundes. Uschi vermutet, dass es seine ist, doch auch er wohnt noch bei seiner Mutter (Marga Legal). Da Uschi immer öfter spät nach Hause kommt, gibt es Ärger mit ihren Eltern. Nach einem heftigen Streit beschließt sie, zu Hans zu ziehen. Doch in seiner vermeintlichen Wohnung öffnet eine junge Frau, die ihr erklärt, dass Hans gar nicht hier wohnt. Mit einem Hoffnungsschimmer für eine gemeinsame Zukunft endet die Liebesgeschichte zweier junger Menschen - einem Mädchen aus Ostberlin und einem jungen Mann aus dem Westsektor der Stadt.
