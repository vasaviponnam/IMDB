Chain-Ying and Wong begin to spend time together and Chain-Ying's friend, Sia-Lien Ho, tells Jien-Sien about his daughter's excursions with the actor and the fact that she has been missing school. Jien-Sien confronts Chain-Ying, who insists that in America, fathers have no rights over their daughters. When Chain-Ying says she loves Wong, Jien-Sien disowns her and then blames Duck Sook for his daughter's infidelity. Wong tells Chain-Ying that she must try to understand the old people's ways and then agrees to marry her, hoping that her father will now accept them. When Duck Sook tries to intervene on the couple's behalf, however, Jien-Sien says that he will never forgive them. The enraged father then goes to the theater owner and tells him to deport Wong, and the owner agrees not to renew the singer's contract, which is soon to expire. Several months later, Wong returns home one night and announces that he must return to China. Worried about his bride, who is now pregnant, he tells her that he will send for her when he has settled. Meanwhile, Duck Sook asks Jien-Sien to forgive his pregnant, lonely daughter, but he refuses. Mao Lee, Jien-Sien's cook, takes pity on Chain-Ying, gives her money and attends the birth of the baby girl. For his disloyalty, Jien-Sien fires Mao-Lee, who joins Duck Sook in taking over a Chinese laundry so that they can support Chain-Ying's baby after Chain-Ying's sudden death. Duck Sook and Mao Lee give the baby a Chinese name, Loy Lo, and an American name, Lulu, and when the girl grows up, Duck Sook teaches her Chinese dances and instills in her a love of the theater.

They are followed by three hard-boiled characters, Fingers, Ziggy and Crusher. Ricky, thinking they are to be rubbed out for deserting Chink, who has been drafted into the Army, stops his car and confronts them. But they merely want to ask Ricky to be their new boss. He declines but promises to call them sometime if the need arises. They are speeding through a Connecticut village and are stopped by yokel Constable Sam Smedley. Judge Paradise, with his daughter Virginia as court clerk, fines them $5.00 each, plus $37 costs - or 30 days in jail. They, while waiting to hear from Jimmy's lawyer, are taken to the cells and are amazed to find the tumbledown jail wide open, with prisoners walking in and out. The door won't lock. The judge explains to Jimmy that Middle Village is unincorporated and broke, its sole income being traffic fines. The town's bonds, for everything from the houses to the village pump, are owned in New York. He also adds that anyone in jail in an unincorporated village is safe from the outside law - Federal,State and City. Ricky, fine paid, hustles back to New York and buys the town bonds for $40,000. Back in Middle Village, Ricky starts the ball rolling; he retains Judge Paradise, sends for Fingers, Ziggy and Crusher, and renovates the jail into a luxurious club. His lawyer then starts a stream of ""customers on the lam"" who pay $1000 a week for the comfort and protection of the Middle Village Jail. New fire chief Crusher, police chief Ziggy and the others board with Henrietta, a maiden lady with aspirations of becoming a gun moll. She also startles them with her collection of wanted posters, their pictures among them. Louie and Henrietta fall for each other. Virginia, in love with Ricky, tries to talk him into doing big things for the town, such as reopening its one-and-only factory. Ricky agrees when the Army offers a defense contract for shell casings. Meanwhile, Chink has gotten out of the Army and buys Louie's half interest in Middle Village.

He selects Marie Bergin who is wanted by the immigration people for having over-stayed her visa. Bob does not adjust his newsreel camera for a long shot and she shows very clearly in close-ups. Promoter Larry Herman sees the newsreel and seeing that she is very talented and very pretty, decides to star her in an ice-spectacle to be called the ""Ice-Capades."" He sends for Karen Vadja's agent, since that is the name the skater is identified as in the newsreel, draws up and signs a contract and invites the press to join him when he meets her. Dismay mildly describes his feeling when he learns that he has obligated himself to build a show around a horse-faced, eccentric woman whose ability to skate is her only saving grace. He calls off the show, and brings suit against the National Newsreel Company for this hoax. The boss, Ellis, blames Bob and his assistant Colonna, who propose that they find her and let Ellis ""discover"" and star her. She evades them as she thinks they are immigration agents trying to find and deport her, but they find her in the chorus of the ice show they want her to star in.

442. Harmon of Michigan,1941,1h 5m,Approved,6.7,71,,"Tom Harmon (ol' # 98 for the Michigan Wolverines, husband of actress Elyse Knox and father of Mark Harmon and Kelly Harmon) took a back seat to no one on the football field (except the Minnesota Gophers) or, later, in the broadcast booth, but, on film, he managed to find himself in two of the all-time bad sports movies...""The Spirit of West Point"" and ""Harmon of Michigan."" The latter, if it had been a true-life biography of Tom Harmon, might have made a passable film but after a short prologue, narrated by sports writer Bill Henry who is not the same as actor William Henry, that semi-recaps Harmon's football-playing days at the University of Michigan, it quickly develops into a mess that indicates the director and writers used the technical adviser, Coach Jeff Cravath, only to put plays on the blackboard. Once Harmon,(supposedly playing himself but the character he plays here has more character flaws than the law allows), graduates from Michigan, he marries his college sweetheart Peggy Adams (Anita Louise), turns up his nose at the prospect of playing professional football---a poor-paying and not-that-well respected job in 1941---and starts a vagabond tour of coaching tank-water colleges. Authenicity went out the window when the narration ended, as did any kind of time tracking, as everything that follows seems to happen in a single football season. Tom takes an assistant coach job at a cow-pasture college under Jimmy Wayburn (William Hall) and lasts one day before Wayburn fires him. Then he signs to play for a College All-Star team doing exhibition games against pro teams, but his team-mates, hacked because Tom gets star billing, lay down on him and he gets smacked down hard on every play. One of the leaders willing to let Harmon get slaughtered is old Michigan teammate Forrest Evashevski (playing himself), a life-long friend in real life and Godfather to Mark Harmon and a long-time respected coach at the University of Iowa. Harmon wins the game by himself, but decides this isn't his cup of tea. He hangs around the house a few weeks, then gets a job as an assistant under old-time coach Pop Branch at a college that has three buildings on campus and a football stadium seating 100,000 fans. He helps Pop win a few games (still ticking along in what appears to be the same fall football season), but the alumni at Webster College are tired of losing, fire their coach and hire Harmon away from Pop. Harmon takes over the Webster team in mid-season and becomes the all-time example of a hard-ass coach willing to win at any cost, including installing a screen-pass play that depends on an illegal blocking scheme---the Flying Wedge---to make it work. His Webster team begins to thump their opponents by large scores, usually leaving the other team battered and bloodied by the use of the illegal blocking scheme. They win four or five games which, based on the writers time scheme, would have them playing 20 games a season in what was then a nine-and-ten game season. Plus, the press and other coaches around and about, are up in arms about Harmon's tactics, but the jerks refereeing the games evidently haven't read the rule book nor the newspapers and throw no penalty flags against his team. Well, one referee does once, but he never officiated nor had lunch in that town again. It, by any reasonable calendar must now be July of the next year in a season that should have ended in December, and hard-case Harmon's team is going up against Pop's team (where Harmon coached earlier in this never-ending season) and Pop drops by and tells Tom he ain't all that fond of Tom's coaching methods, but Tom poo-pahs him off, and then sends his team out and they gleefully dismantle Pop's fair-playing team by 109-0. But Webster's quarterback Freddie Davis (Stanley Brown) suffers a concussion running a play Harmon calls just to run up the score even higher---Harmon evidently didn't read the script because nobody using their own name would want this character perceived as Himself---and it's nip-and-tuck whether Freddie will get out of the hospital alive. It gets even stickier when Freddie parents drop their hospital vigil long enough to tell Tom they are right proud that he is Freddie's coach. Say what? Tom sees the light and reverts back to the good old boy he started out as.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0033691/?ref_=sr_i_442,"['Richard Goldstone', 'Stanley Rauh', 'Fredric M.

Pete has been induced to make this move by his uncle, Joe Walker (Robert Fiske), who ran afoul of the law twenty years past, but is presumably now a honest citizen. In reality, he is the same crook he was in the past. He and his partner, Nick Barter (LeRoy Mason), obtain a government contract to build a road through the territory and are exploiting the settlers and forcing them to work on the road gang for little or no pay, through the use of script money they issue. The purpose for luring Pete and his friends is to obtain more labor. Walker has his henchmen, disguised as Indians, raid the wagon train, stampede the stock and destroy the supply wagon, and the distitute group reaches Rock Creek and are dependent on Walker's dubious largesse in giving them jobs on his road gang. When government funds to pay the workers comes through, Walker has his gang hold up the gold-carrying coach, and forces the laborers to accept script redeemable at one-fourth of its face value. Pete becomes aware of what is happening, so when the next payroll shipment comes through he holds up the coach himself before Walker's henchmen have a chance to, and sends the money into town to the sheriff, so that the workers will be paid in real money. He continues this procedure week after week and Walker posts a huge reward for the bandit whom he calls ""The Apache Kid.""

482. Arkansas Judge,1941,1h 12m,Approved,6.5,64,,"Peaceful Valley town-founder, Judge Abner Weaver is distressed when the townspeople begin gossiping and ""bearing false witness'"" against Mary Shoemaker , the community handy-woman, who is charged with having stolen fifty dollars from Widow Smithers , and he and his wife Elviry and brother Cicero stoutly defend Mary. The theft becomes a matter of community interest when a rumor is circulated that Hettie Huston , daughter of the local banker, August Houston, has stolen the money in order to buy an expensive evening gown with which to dazzle Tom Martel, a young lawyer whose legal education was sponsored by Judge Weaver, whose daughter Margaret is also in love with Tom, and the young lawyer is torn between the sophisticated attractions of Hettie and the simple charm of Margaret. In order to save his daughter's reputation, August Houston is eager to have Mary Shoemaker's guilt established and to induce her to quietly leave town. Judge Weaver (not on the bench)defends her so heatedly that Huston institutes a slander-suit against his old friend, charging him with having damaged Hettie's reputation. Margaret feels that inasmuch as her father has financed Tom's legal education, it is his duty to defend her father. But Tom is smitten with Hettie and proposes to her, and refuses to side against her in the trial. As the trial proceeds, it becomes apparent that all the witnesses are testifying against Judge Weaver because Huston and his bank hold notes and mortgages on their homes and businesses. Tom can stand it no longer and determines to defend the Judge, even though it may mean breaking his engagement to Hettie, no matter how smitten he may be. When it is suggested that Judge Weaver started the rumor against Hettie because his daughter was in love with Tom and jealous of Hettie, Tom puts Margaret on the stand and asks her to refute the statement. Margaret cannot swear, under oath, that she doesn't love Tom; and, as a result of her admission of love, the case is lost. But Huston magnanimously declines to accept from Judge Weaver the judgment the court has awarded him, on condition that Mary Shoemaker be sent out of town. Judge Weaver, knowing that Mary was not the one who stole the money, declines the offer. Meanwhile, a group of the town's riff-raff decide to take matter in their own hands and set fire to Mary's House. BUT, Mary is inside the house.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0033353/?ref_=sr_i_482,"['Irving Stone', 'Ring Lardner Jr.', 'Ian McLellan Hunter']",['Frank McDonald'],"['Leon Weaver', 'Frank Weaver', 'June Weaver', 'Roy Rogers', 'Spring Byington', 'Pauline Moore', 'Frank M.

Eileen pleads with Avery and Crandall to continue their search for a backer because John refuses to marry her until he has a job. The producers try to convince Eileen to invest in their play, but she tells them that her fortune is held in trust by her reclusive aunt Hattie, who is dominated by her imperious business manager, Harvey Parker. Learning that Hattie has sequestered herself in the house for thirty years while waiting for the return of her long-lost love, Charlie Farley, the first mate on a whaling ship, Avery and Crandall decide to pose as Charlie's mates and visit Hattie. After informing Hattie of her beloved Charlie's demise, Avery and Crandall present her with Charlie's most cherished possession: a play that he wrote for her. In memoriam, Hattie asks the two to take her to a riverfront bar that she and Charlie used to frequent. There Hattie learns that Charlie's shipmates are impostors when the bartender shows her a photograph of a very alive Charlie with his arms around two women. To teach Avery and Crandall a lesson, Hattie incites a night of barroom brawling, after which the beaten producers confess their true identity and ask her for money. Hattie sends Harvey to meet with the producers, and he agrees to recommend that she finance their play if Avery and Crandall will pay him twenty percent of the proceeds. After Hattie advances the producers the first half of her payment, rehearsals begin. The production proceeds smoothly until Harvey, who is in love with Eileen, learns that she and John are engaged and demands a new leading man before delivering the final check. To placate Harvey, Crandall proposes that Avery play the lead in dress rehearsal until they receive Hattie's check, and then John will step into the role on opening night. When Avery becomes enamored by his own performance, however, he decides to continue the role. On opening night, Crandall arranges for a sandbag to drop on Avery's head, but the bag misses Avery and hits Harvey instead. Retiring to his dressing room to adjust his makeup, Avery is confronted by two robbers, who knock him unconscious. When Harvey's meek assistant Holly tells Hattie that the business manager has been swindling her, Hattie gives Eileen and John her blessing. John steps into the leading role, and as the play is about to begin, Crandall is hit by a sandbag. When the two producers finally awaken in the hospital, they rush to the theater ,where they are greeted by a sign announcing that their play is in its second successful month.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0033615/?ref_=sr_i_486,"['Bert Granet', 'Ian McLellan Hunter', 'Paul Gerard Smith']",['Irving Reis'],"['Alan Mowbray', 'Donald MacBride', 'Elisabeth Risdon', 'Lee Bonnell', 'Elyse Knox', 'Charles Quigley', 'Georgia Backus', 'Jay Belasco', 'Eddie Borden', 'Frank Bruno']",,,,,"March 21, 1941",['United States'],"['RKO Studios - 780 N.
