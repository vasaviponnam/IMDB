As thunder and lightning begin, the countess Madalaine's first husband, Paul Szegedy, who everyone thought had committed suicide, calls her and threatens to create a scandal that will ruin Peter's career unless she comes to his room at the Hotel Orient. After she agrees, Lisa, her maid, tells Peter about Szegedy's threat. At the hotel, as Szegedy packs to leave, his mistress and vaudeville partner, Katherine Szabo, pleads with him to stay. Professor Omega, a self-proclaimed mystic with whom Katherine toured before she met Szegedy, overhears their conversation and then warns Szegedy of disaster evidenced in a fearful vision of thunder in the night. Katherine goes to the police station across the street from the hotel and asks that they stop Szegedy from leaving her. An automobile crash interrupts her pleas, and after Torok and Gabor, his bumbling lieutenant, go outside to investigate, a porter from the hotel tells them that Szegedy has been murdered. Torok determines that Szegedy was shot in the heart. Julie, the maid, says that she saw a woman come to Szegedy's room twice, and Professor Omega says that he heard Szegedy quarrel with a woman on the staircase. Torok finds a newspaper with an article torn out and some expensive writing paper crumbled up. After he learns that the missing article was about the rumor that Peter was going to become the president of the cabinet, Torok questions the taxi driver involved in the crash and learns that he swerved to avoid hitting a woman who came running from the hotel wearing a black raincoat and black silk stockings. At a ball that night in honor of Peter's triumph, Gabor discovers the raincoat. Although Madalaine denies wearing it that night, after the the prefect reveals that the dead man was Madalaine's first husband, Torok searches her room and finds envelopes matching the paper found in Szegedy's room and muddy shoes and stockings. The prefect then arrests Madalaine. At Torok's request, he interrogates her in Szegedy's room. Madalaine admits that she did come to the room earlier that night but denies killing Szegedy, saying that she only gave him 25,000 pengars in an envelope to keep him quiet. To protect his wife, Peter then confesses that he killed Szegedy. After Torok proves that the professor had been in Szegedy's room, the professor admits that he stole the money, but says that Szegedy was already dead when he entered the room.

He is instead in love with the Hungarian Countess Zarika Rafay, which Gustl can't tell his uncle since he disapproves of her family. The Emperor will allow Gustl to sow his wild oats before getting married, but that woman needs to be someone ""harmless"" outside of the royal circle. Since they discuss this situation while at the ballet, Gustl instead tells the Emperor that he is in love with one of the ballerinas, and the one he has chosen somewhat at random is the always distracted Lisl Gluck, who is considered the worst dancer in the company since she is always staring at the man she intends to marry, the ballet company's piano accompanist Toni Berngruber. When Gustl summons Lisl, she is relieved to learn his true intentions - that she is just a front while he cavorts secretly with the Countess (although he tells her nothing of his impending marriage to the Princess) - but less so when she learns that that requires her to live in his royal house. She agrees when Gustl promises to produce Toni's ballet in return. Although Toni knows nothing about the agreement between Lisl and Gustl, Lisl running off with Gustl does not sit well with him, who believes he can get any woman to replace Lisl. As Lisl and Gustl live their separate lives together, they find they have a fun time together, the other being different than those in their own social class. But an incident between Lisl, Toni and Gustl shows Lisl where her true feeling lie, those which were evident to Gustl much earlier.

The relatives, assembled at the Hudson country home, are Aunt Catherine, a crabby dowager; Sarah , her bitter, unmarried daughter; Cousin Ellwood, a simple, good-natured drunk cousin; and the heiress' uncle, Dr. Silas Hudson, who is an archery expert. A big-game hunting arrow sticking in Helen's (posing as the heiress) bedroom door is the first warning or danger, and all hands begin to cast wary glances in the direction of Uncle Silas. Jeanne bravely offers to sleep in Helen's room on a chaise lounge. A prowler, attacked by Lobo, leaves the dog apparently dying and, as the weapon of choice was a rake, Reynolds, the gardener, joins Uncle Silas as a suspect. But a second arrow later rips through a rowboat carrying Larry and Helen. And, a third plows through Jeannie's chaise lounge as she jumps to protect Helen when she sees a secret panel in the bedroom open. Then, Reynolds, who is a private detective hired by who-knows-who is done in by an arrow-shot only an archery expert could have made.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0026443/?ref_=sr_i_354,['Lambert Hillyer'],['Lambert Hillyer'],"['Robert Allen', 'Florence Rice', 'Ward Bond', 'Wyrley Birch', 'Barbara Kent', 'Arthur Hohl', 'Elisabeth Risdon', 'Nana Bryant', 'Thurston Hall', 'Bert Roach']",,,,,"November 2, 1935",['United States'],,['Columbia Pictures'],,"['Action', 'Adventure', 'Comedy', 'Mystery', 'Thriller']",['English']

Sykes, a snooping reporter, climbs onto their rumble seat as Betty heads upstate heedless of Maggie's warning that that part of the country is full of crazy people. As they near the Summit Lodge, Sykes is knocked into the bushes. Nearby, at the Melleh Bros. Wild Animal Circus, tiger trainer Lola rebukes her philandering husband Jose, who then opens the cage of Lola's tiger Mina so that Lola will be preoccupied while he pursues recreation. While searching for Mina, Lola comes across Giffen and Camebridge Nasher, two loony moonshiners, and promises to hire them as acrobats if they help find the tiger. Betty pays Matt, a partner of the Nashers in applejack production, ten dollars to stay in the lodge. When Jose serenades her under her window, Betty is excited to hear that he just wants to make love, rather than reason with her, like Caleb. After Maggie calls Caleb to tell him their location, Sykes arrives at the lodge. Betty denies her identity to him, but when Caleb arrives, Sykes takes notes as Betty explains that she is bored with him and cannot go through with the wedding. As Betty walks off arm in arm with Jose, Caleb, seeing Sykes about to phone in the story about their breakup, wraps the phone line around his neck. With Matt's help, Caleb drops Sykes into a cellar. When Lola arrives with her whip, Jose sneaks out. After Caleb receives advice from Matt that women prefer force to reason, he enters Betty's room, where Jose has returned. When Caleb asks if he intends to marry Betty, Jose leaves by the window, and after Betty closes the door on Caleb, she climbs out to Jose. To help Caleb, Matt kidnaps Maggie, thinking her to be Betty, and they drive off, but return when they discover that they really have Maggie. When Lola catches Jose embracing Betty, he tells Betty to wait in the loft of the barn and then runs from Lola. Caleb captures Jose for Lola, while Maggie falls into the cellar with Sykes. After Caleb ties up Jose, he instructs Caleb in courtship technique, explaining that he is in love with love, and tells him that Betty is waiting in the barn. As Caleb confronts Betty, the tiger comes into the barn. Although Caleb's first reaction is to run, he then grabs a whip and makes the tiger lie down and roll over. After the Nashers see this and tell Lola, she reclaims the tiger, whom she says she had tamed by never letting her forget that she is the master. With his whip, Caleb orders Betty down from the loft and kisses her passionately. Never having experienced such a kiss from him, Betty wants more.

At the same time, Dan and his wife Nora send their tomboyish daughter Molly to an expensive girls' school to teach her etiquette. Molly only agrees to go after her sweetheart, Sandy MacTavish, convinces her she should. When Dan is unable to complete the apartments because of a lack of money, Sandy's father Jock, a Scottish barber and Dan's best friend, secretly backs Dan's loan at the bank, even though Jock is known for his penny-pinching ways. When Jock mistakenly shaves off a clump of hair from the back of Dan's head, however, then wants to charge him for the cut, Dan ends their friendship. With Jock's loan, Dan finishes his tenement, while Molly spends the summer at her classmate Mary Ellen Hall's estate outside Chicago. Molly, who has turned into a lady and has fallen for Mary Ellen's brother Robert, denies her working-class background. Mr. Hall, head of a major construction firm, offers to go into business with Dan after he opens a New York office and is eager to meet him. Dan is elected president of the hod-carriers union and gets to lead the Labor Day Parade. Molly happens to be in town for the event with the Halls, who view the parade with haughty eyes from a hotel balcony. When Dan recognizes his daughter, he proudly blows her a kiss from the street, but she pretends not to know him, breaking his heart. Later, at home, Dan scolds Molly for her behavior, and she apologizes, but convinces her father to transform their flat into a fancy, modern apartment in time for Halls' return from Boston. The McFaddens then host a housewarming party, sending invitations to all their neighbors. The night of the party, Mary Ellen calls and Dan spontaneously invites the Halls. Robert arrives drunk and makes a pass at Molly, after telling her his mother has forbidden him to marry her and insulting her father. Sandy, who was broken-hearted to find Molly so attentive to the Halls, hits Robert for accosting Molly. Mr. Hall and Dan, meanwhile, have been getting drunk together and have discovered they are from the same neighborhood, where they both started out as bricklayers. During their drunken reverie, they have a contest to see who can first complete a wall made out of books. Mrs. Hall leaves in a huff, calling the McFaddens ""riff-raff,"" and Dan is sure he has lost his chance to do business with Hall.

Laurie-Lou introduces Freckles to Mary Arden, her pretty schoolteacher, who then introduces him to McLean. At Mary's urging, McLean employs Freckles to guard the vast Limberlost against timber thieves. With Laurie-Lou's help, Freckles learns about the forest and gradually becomes comfortable in his new surroundings. At the same time, Mary gives Freckles botany books to read and, attracted to him, encourages him to visit her at home. After McLean runs into Jack Carter, a convicted timber thief, at Laurie-Lou's mother's general store, he alerts Freckles and his other workers to keep a careful watch on the trees. Carter, who gives Laurie-Lou wooden soldiers that he has carved, is actually hiding out in the Limberlost with fellow bank robbers Al Waters, Butch and Lefty. While McLean and his lumberjacks are cutting down a tree that had been marked by would-be timber thieves, Laurie-Lou ties Cubby to a log to prevent him from eating her candy. When Laurie-Lou realizes that the tree is going to fall near Cubby, she rushes to untie him but is pulled away by Freckles just as the giant trunk is descending on her. Cubby survives his injuries, and a relieved Laurie-Lou is able to participate in Mary's school variety show. Later Laurie-Lou, desperate to have Carter carve her a captain for her wooden doll collection, hides in his car one afternoon and rides with him to his cabin. Carter, whose photograph has just appeared in the newspapers, keeps the innocent Laurie-Lou at the hideout, unsure of what to do with her. Eventually Freckles shows up and spots Laurie-Lou in the cabin. Carter and his men capture Freckles, but Freckles executes a surprise escape and, after being shot, locks himself with Laurie-Lou in a back room. When Laurie-Lou discovers Al's machine gun in the room, she shows Freckles how to load and shoot it. Although suffering, Freckles confronts Carter and his men, who have hacked their way into the room with axes, and holds them at gunpoint until Mary and an F.B.I. agent arrive on the scene.

Without Frank on the program, Ninón Silk Stockings, the show's sponsor, begins to lose sales. The president of the company, John Baxter, and his bored daughter Lolita, are then dismayed to learn that Frank has begun to work for their competitor, Bon Soir Stockings. After learning that Frank is stealing their customers, Lolita convinces her father and his associates, who do not believe that women can do ""men's"" work, to let her sell stockings. Using the name of Mary Smith, Lolita makes an appointment with Mr. Morán, one of Frank's customers, and then sells him 150 gross of stockings. Discovering that he is being undermined, Frank determines to win his next sale with a man named Fishback, whom he meets for dinner. At the restaurant, Fishback confesses that women are his weakness and eyes ""Mary"" from across the room. Not realizing that she is the salesperson who stole his customer, Frank enlists her help. When Fishback places his order for 300 gross, Lolita uses the Ninón order form without Frank's knowledge. After this second failure, Frank travels to Pottsville, where his customer, Mr. Brown, meets him at the station to tell him that he's already signed an order for Ninón stockings. At an inn in Pottsville, Frank meets Lolita, still in the guise of Mary, and having caught on to the fact that she is stealing his trade, gives her a list of the customers he's planning to see and challenges her to steal them away. The next morning on the train, Frank dresses up like the porter and tricks Lolita into getting off at the wrong stop. When Frank jokingly tells the conductor about the ruse, the conductor places him under arrest. Lolita gets Frank out of jail and tells him that the customer he has come to see, Mr. Evans, is out of town. They decide to declare a truce, and Lolita suggests that they take the rest of the afternoon off. They drive to an isolated spot for a picnic, and when Frank makes a pass at Lolita, she breaks their agreement by returning to the city and leaving him stranded. At Ninón headquarters, Baxter slights Conroy as they plan for the upcoming Annual Stocking Show. At the show, Frank flaunts his new advertising slogan, ""Follow me -- I won't run,"" which he has printed on buttons. In the Ninón dressing room, Conroy, to sabotage Lolita, takes one of Frank's buttons and rips holes in the Ninón stockings. When the models appear in ripped hose, the audience is aghast. Next, Frank sings a song for Bon Soir Stockings and sends his models out into the audience for orders. Lolita stops Fishback as he is about to place an order and, after telling the customers that the runs in Ninón's hosiery were the work of a diabolical competitor, demonstrates their resilience. After the customers flock to buy from Lolita, Frank's boss, who believes that he sabotaged the Ninón show, fires him. Frank then visits Lolita at her home and still unaware of her true identity, mistakenly thinks that Baxter, her father, is making sexual advances toward her. Frank hits Baxter in the face, and after the misunderstanding is cleared up, Frank explains that Conroy ruined the show. Baxter then agrees to rehire Frank, while he and Lolita plan their wedding.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0207651/?ref_=sr_i_513,"['José López Rubio', 'Frederica Sagor Maas', 'Paul Perez']",['John Boland'],"['Rosita Moreno', 'Raul Roulien', 'Enrique de Rosas', 'Francisco Moreno', 'Romualdo Tirado', 'Manuel Peluffo', 'Rodolfo Hoyos', 'Manuel París', 'Antonio Vidal', 'Rosita Granada']",,,,,"October 4, 1935",['United States'],,['Fox Film Corporation'],,"['Comedy', 'Romance']",['Spanish']

Henry cannot adjust to modern London and the cold treatment he receives from his former friends, so he goes to France. While there he meets Sally, the bratty child of neglectful Claudine Pym, and Sally's governess, the shy but caring Elsie Summerstone. Henry is taken with Elsie, and to spend more time with her, he becomes friends with Sally, whose mother treats Elsie shabbily. One night, when Claudine goes to Monte Carlo with her rich, pompous boyfriend, Monte Alabaster, Sally leads Elsie on a chase through the hotel corridors and falls down the stairs. Henry helps Elsie take care of the child, who suffers a fractured arm, but when he finally succeeds in reaching Claudine, she says she will not return until the following morning. When Claudine returns, she yells at Elsie for allowing Sally to come to harm. Sally rises to Elsie's defense, and Claudine strikes her injured daughter. Claudine then fires Elsie, but when Elsie asks for the two months back wages owed to her so that she can return to England, Claudine cannot pay her and so rehires her. After Sally's recovery, Henry and Elsie watch her play, and Henry tells Elsie the story of his crime and punishment. Although she is usually compassionate, Elsie is horrified and runs off. Henry is disappointed, for he had hoped to marry Elsie, and he leaves the hotel. Elsie realizes her mistake and goes to apologize, but it is too late. After discovering that Henry is gone, Elsie also finds out that her mother is dangerously ill. Claudine gives Elsie a check for her wages, but the English consul cannot cash it. Elsie returns to the hotel and in desperation takes some money from Claudine's purse, which is not as empty as Claudine had claimed. Claudine sees Elsie take the money, and after they quarrel, Elsie throws Claudine to the ground. Claudine has Elsie arrested for robbery and attempted murder, and despite the obvious injustices committed against Elsie, she is convicted and sentenced to the Maison Masque, a prison where the inmates must where masks. During the trial, Sally locates Henry, and although he appeals to Humphrey Grylls, the British consul, nothing can be done. Henry visits Elsie, telling her that she is not alone, and that they have a bright future together. Outside the courthouse, Henry finds Sally, who has run away to visit Elsie. Not far behind her is Claudine, who arrogantly ignores the traffic and is run over and killed. Eventually, after many appeals, Grylls succeeds in obtaining Elsie's release.

His rapport with them leads to his promotion to general manager, and then vice-president, over Ed Tanahill (John Eldredge), cousin of Harrison Balding (Joseph King), the mill's owner. 

Bitter about being passed over, Tanahill and his secretary, Vida (Mary Astor), plot to keep Chris from interacting directly with the workers. With Tanahill's encouragement, Chris spends his time golfing and monitoring progress on the construction of his expensive new house. His old friends in the mill feel abandoned. Only Tom Martin (Joseph Crehan) is sure that Chris is still on their side. 

Chris's wife Bessie Bessie (Dorothy Peterson) is also unhappy about the change in their life. She misses her old friends and begs Chris to return to his former job. When Balding takes a vacation, leaving Chris in charge, things completely fall apart at the mill. The men are angry that they must work overtime for no extra money to repair a mistake that Chris failed to catch. But Chris knows only what Tanahill tells him, or fails to tell him, and Tanahill successfully creates a toxic relationship between Bennett and the factory workers.

After the job is finished, the workers ask to go back on regular time, but Tanahill lies and tells the workers that Chris has ordered the new hours to continue indefinitely. The men become agitated and walk out, then when the gates are locked behind them they view that as further evidence that they are being abused, and they begin throwing rocks and breaking windows. Tanahill calls the police.

Chris is pulled away from a housewarming party at his new home and he arrives at the mill to confront the men. He tells them he didn't post the order about continuing indefinitely with the work schedule. They think he's lying and goad him into coming out from behind the gate. Chris goes outside the gate and warns the men to quit protesting or the police may hurt some of them. They don't listen and Chris is forced to defend himself when several of them attack him. He's knocked unconscious before the police arrive and disperse the mob.

As Bennett is revived inside the Mill office, the boiler mechanic, Collins (John Qualen), asked him to confirm what he knew about the problems in the mill, and what orders he'd issued. When it's apparent that Tanahill was at the heart of creating an atmosphere of miscommunication and mistrust, Collins punches out Tanahill, and tells the others assembled, ""let that be a lesson to you guys, to punch the right man the next time.""

Chris learned his lessons well and he returns to work closely with the men in the mill, becoming the manager everyone thought and hoped he'd be.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0026674/?ref_=sr_i_539,"['William Wister Haines', 'Dawn Powell']",['William C.
