After she agrees, Lisa, her maid, tells Peter about Szegedy's threat. At the hotel, as Szegedy packs to leave, his mistress and vaudeville partner, Katherine Szabo, pleads with him to stay. Professor Omega, a self-proclaimed mystic with whom Katherine toured before she met Szegedy, overhears their conversation and then warns Szegedy of disaster evidenced in a fearful vision of thunder in the night. Katherine goes to the police station across the street from the hotel and asks that they stop Szegedy from leaving her. An automobile crash interrupts her pleas, and after Torok and Gabor, his bumbling lieutenant, go outside to investigate, a porter from the hotel tells them that Szegedy has been murdered. Torok determines that Szegedy was shot in the heart. Julie, the maid, says that she saw a woman come to Szegedy's room twice, and Professor Omega says that he heard Szegedy quarrel with a woman on the staircase. Torok finds a newspaper with an article torn out and some expensive writing paper crumbled up. After he learns that the missing article was about the rumor that Peter was going to become the president of the cabinet, Torok questions the taxi driver involved in the crash and learns that he swerved to avoid hitting a woman who came running from the hotel wearing a black raincoat and black silk stockings. At a ball that night in honor of Peter's triumph, Gabor discovers the raincoat. Although Madalaine denies wearing it that night, after the the prefect reveals that the dead man was Madalaine's first husband, Torok searches her room and finds envelopes matching the paper found in Szegedy's room and muddy shoes and stockings. The prefect then arrests Madalaine. At Torok's request, he interrogates her in Szegedy's room. Madalaine admits that she did come to the room earlier that night but denies killing Szegedy, saying that she only gave him 25,000 pengars in an envelope to keep him quiet. To protect his wife, Peter then confesses that he killed Szegedy. After Torok proves that the professor had been in Szegedy's room, the professor admits that he stole the money, but says that Szegedy was already dead when he entered the room. Torok then deduces the solution to the murder and demonstrates that Katherine, left alone in the police station while he and Gabor investigated the crash, saw Szegedy look out from his window and, being a sharpshooter, killed him with a gun Gabor left in the office. Katherine then shoots herself, and the prefect, at Torok's suggestion, apologizes and agrees not to make public the fact that Szegedy was Madalaine's first husband.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0027105/?ref_=sr_i_290

The Emperor will allow Gustl to sow his wild oats before getting married, but that woman needs to be someone ""harmless"" outside of the royal circle. Since they discuss this situation while at the ballet, Gustl instead tells the Emperor that he is in love with one of the ballerinas, and the one he has chosen somewhat at random is the always distracted Lisl Gluck, who is considered the worst dancer in the company since she is always staring at the man she intends to marry, the ballet company's piano accompanist Toni Berngruber. When Gustl summons Lisl, she is relieved to learn his true intentions - that she is just a front while he cavorts secretly with the Countess (although he tells her nothing of his impending marriage to the Princess) - but less so when she learns that that requires her to live in his royal house. She agrees when Gustl promises to produce Toni's ballet in return. Although Toni knows nothing about the agreement between Lisl and Gustl, Lisl running off with Gustl does not sit well with him, who believes he can get any woman to replace Lisl. As Lisl and Gustl live their separate lives together, they find they have a fun time together, the other being different than those in their own social class.

Owen then hires Raymond Cortell, a crooked lawyer, to act as the criminal's defense. Cortell not only keeps crooks and gunmen out of jail by manipulating legal technicalities, but spurs them to more crime by demanding large fees for his legal services. Cortell assigns the case to one of his unwary younger partners, Mary Kennedy, who is the daughter of police captain Jim Kennedy. Mary wins an acquittal by utilizing the tricks Cortell suggests, becoming adept at serving as a criminal ""mouthpiece."" Dave, Mary's fiancé, is dismayed by her action, and the two quarrel, but they make up, and she agrees to quit her job and marry Dave when he is promoted to lieutenant. Dave soon investigates a jewel robbery at Owen's office, and aided by the eye-witness account of a janitor and his own deductions, he charges Owen with murdering a diamond salesman and accuses him of carrying out the crime in a way in which no suspicion would fall on him. Mary is again the defense attorney for Owen, and by confusing the janitor on the witness stand with questions pertaining to the moonlight on the night of the murder and comparing his answer to an almanac, she obtains an acquittal. Mary becomes famous, but Dave and her father are angry at the tactics she has used. In order to pay Cortell, Owen robs a jewelry store and shoots Jim in the process. Mary at last realizes the error of her ways. The wounded Jim identifies Owen, and with Mary's help, Dave is able to capture him and to arrest Cortell for receiving stolen property.
