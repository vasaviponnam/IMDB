Some credibility is lost when, warming up before going after the white tiger, Roberts lassos a saladang which is advertised as being the most feared animal in the world.

But later on, Roberts is captured by a fierce tribe of natives, gets clawed by a tiger, rescues Mamo Clark from being sacrificed, and has several encounters with pythons, who appear to not be an endangered species as they are hanging from every tree limb in Malaya. Jayne Regan provides the romantic interest as the---what else when British officers are concerned---Colonel's daughter.

Hoffman Sr. and Jr.,and never released because of the collapse and merger of the Hoffman's Liberty Company into the newly-formed Republic operation in mid-1935, and consequently has two different sets of actors and production crew members.

Scott Darling, cameraman Tom Galligan, editor Dan Milner, assistant director Milton Brown, noted animal trainer Jack Lindell(who also had a film role) and actors Frank Campeau, Wally Albright, Edward Peil Sr. and Morgan Brown. It was filmed in the vicinity of Fredonia, Arizona and this group in no way functioned as a 2nd unit. They were making their own film. The film went unreleased, and George A. Hirliman took it over for his Condor Productions unit at Grand National, and shot additional footage directed by Samuel Diege, with Jack Greenhalgh on camera, Carl Pierson editing, two songs from Lew Porter, and Arthur Hoerl and Paul Franklin writing additional dialogue for the ""Hirliman"" flash-back cast of Hobart Bosworth, Harry Harvey and his son Harry Harvey, Jr. The Hoffman group was in Arizona, where a group of ranchers in the area south of the Utah border and east of the Colorado River had appealed to the Department of the Interior for relief against the great herds of wild mustangs that roamed the range, already stripped of most vegetation by dust storms and drought. The U.S. government contractors, under the authority of the Taylor Grazing Bill, undertook the task of rounding up nearly 3000 wild mustangs using airplanes, mounted cowboys and bright reflectors. Frank Gay wrote a wild horse story built around this impending roundup involving a rancher's son(Wally Albright) and a crusty old-timer (Frank Campeau). Jack Lindell had work for his stable of trained horses, including ""Rex"", King of the Wild Horses (as ""El Diablo"",the villain horse) and ""Sheik"", the New Wonder Hose (as ""Whitey"", the hero horse), who are the only credited ""names"" on the posters and advertising.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0030324/?ref_=sr_i_395

Ladies in Distress,1938,54m,Approved,7.1,18,,"Josephine Bonney, the mayor of Bonneyville and a former schoolteacher, is besieged by town citizens demanding action when a gang of ruthless racketeers establishes a ""Merchants' Protective Association"" and roughs up any who do not join. The drive to recall Jo is led by attorney Fred Morgan, a would-be candidate for her job, who is actually the boss of the racketeers, assisted by businessman Daniel J. Roman. Jo assures her constituents that she is sending for a man who can control the situation, after which she secretly hires Pete Braddock, a former pupil who has retained affectionate feelings for her in spite of his own decline into gangsterism. Despite her sister Lydia's distrust of Pete, Jo is certain that he can go straight and clean up the town from which he ran away fifteen years ago. Jo introduces Pete to police chief Dave Evans as John Wilson, a special investigator from Chicago. Jo insists that Pete stay at her house, and he quickly becomes enamored of her lovely niece Sally, who knows his true identity as the town's former bad boy. The night of his arrival, Pete and Sally visit one of the gambling joints run by the racketeers, and Pete captures the two thugs sent to kill him after he wins big at the tables. The next day, the thugs give Pete the addresses of the town's other gambling establishments, and soon Pete has smashed the gambling ring. Jo holds another town meeting and introduces Pete as John Wilson, and the town cheers him. Pete then visits Roman, whom he warns to get out of town. While they are talking, Morgan enters the office and, before he sees Pete, reveals that he is head of the gang. Pete tells Morgan that he also must leave town, but quickly changes his tune when Morgan and Roman offer him a large bribe. Pete agrees to accept $25,000 over a four-week period in exchange for his silence, and he aids them in making their protective society legitimate by publishing a magazine in which merchants are forced to advertise. Two weeks pass as Pete and the racketeers rake in money, until Jo collapses on her birthday, which Pete had forgotten for the first time in fifteen years. Pete is grief-stricken over Jo's illness, and her and Sally's absolute faith in him prompts him to inform Roman and Morgan that the deal is off. Roman laughingly tells Pete that he is in too deep, and threatens to tell Jo about the bribes if he does not leave town. Ashamed and discouraged, Pete leaves town, and Morgan demands Jo's recall. At a town meeting, Jo wearily tells the citizens that she will offer no defense and is about to resign, when a bloodied Pete arrives, bearing a beaten Roman and the ledgers that will convict the racketeers. Pete reveals Morgan's leadership of the gang, and the crowd cheers Pete and Jo. After Lydia agrees to marry Dave, and Sally embraces Pete, Jo cheerfully admits that she had no idea Pete was temporarily in with the gang.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0030339/?ref_=sr_i_542
