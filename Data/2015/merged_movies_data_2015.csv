Ultimately rejected by Hollywood and maliciously maligned by conservative Americans, Eisenstein traveled to Mexico in 1931 to consider a film privately funded by American pro-Communist sympathizers, headed by the American writer Upton Sinclair. Eisenstein's sensual Mexican experience appears to have been pivotal in his life and film career - a significant hinge between the early successes of Strike, Battleship Potemkin, and October, which made him a world-renowned figure, and his hesitant later career with Alexander Nevsky, Ivan the Terrible and The Boyar's Plot.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1702429/?ref_=sr_i_458,['Peter Greenaway'],['Peter Greenaway'],"['Elmer Bäck', 'Luis Alberti', 'Maya Zapata', 'Lisa Owen', 'José Montini', 'Cristina Velasco Lozano', 'Rasmus Slätis', 'Jakob Öhrman', 'Sara Juárez', 'Alaín Vargas']","€2,472,000 (estimated)","$9,823","$91,916","$34,282","June 18, 2015","['Netherlands', 'Belgium', 'Finland', 'Mexico', 'France']","['Guanajuato, Guanajuato, Mexico (on location)']","['Submarine', 'Fu Works', 'Paloma Negra Films']","Awards, 2 wins & 10 nominations total","['Biography', 'Comedy', 'Drama', 'Romance']","['English', 'Spanish']"

Fifteen years they have spent working on the pear arbour. Will it finally close over this year? Despite his old age, the pruning master is still inexhaustible and driven. As he worries about the loss of centuries of knowledge, the younger gardener makes a real effort of soaking up all this knowledge and passing it on. Meanwhile the seasons go by. The gardening lady works the vegetable patches, the citrus trees leave their winter accommodation and we get to meet the Apple Blossom Beetle.
