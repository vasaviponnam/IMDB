As a minor, the boy must be returned to his father and step-mother who live in Paris. Paul is sent to England to go to school. Upon completion of his graduation from prep school with honors (""all the prizes""), Paul begins to search for Michelle, learning from her cousin that Michelle had to take refuge in a nunnery. Paul visits with one of the nuns there, Sister Mercier, and quickly finds out that Michelle was placed in a Pâtisserie owned by Monsieur Bellancourt in Nice where Paul subsequently discovers she lived and worked for about six months... then one day, Michelle suddenly walked out. Advised by a fellow employee who has seen Michelle in the market place the week before, Paul learns that Michelle is still in Nice. After a series of near-misses, Paul eventually finds Michelle who has begun a life of her own with an older man, Garry, an airline pilot, and yet, Paul ultimately succeeds in rekindling their love. Garry departs for a job in New York and Paul and Michelle resettle in Paris. Paul's father who considers Michelle a tramp and his son a fool, cuts off Paul's allowance. This plunges Paul and Michelle into dire financial straits where they both must work menial jobs while Paul must attend classes at the university as well, all the while raising Sylvie. Both of them exhausted, the lovers quarrel about Paul's ability to remain faithful. In addition, Michelle must face having an unexpected abortion. It becomes clear that Michelle and Sylvie must go back to the Camargue so Paul can go it alone to the Sorbonne to acquire a degree and the necessary financial means.

To calm the jittery Anja, Peter relates a series of erotic stories to put her back in the mood:

Scene 1: Ingrid (Ulrike Butz) is hanging out with her friends at a bar, gets a bit drunk and picks up by a fast-moving Lothario who deflowers her. Although she regrets her first-time choice, she's now obsessed with getting enjoyment from sex. A series of men prove unable to satisfy her, but when her friend Lilo (Puppa Armbruster) drops in for a sleep-over, she finally experiences the physical release shes been seeking! Not yet ready to give up on men, Ingrid initiates our inexperienced protagonist, Peter, and finds him to be a considerate and satisfying lover.

Scene 2: Next is a lederhosen tale involving the buxom Maria (Jane Iwanoff) who is having it off with her beau, Toni, when they're interrupted by her grandfather. Toni wants to make an honest woman of Maria -- but his father is against it. Wiley old gramps knows Aloisius is boffing all the wives in town, including Maria's mother (Elke Deuringer). He and Toni don't have to wait long to catch him in the act, and blackmail him into approving the union.

Scene 3: Professor Staudinger conducts an art class in which one of his students shows promise, so he invites her to a private class in which he poses nude, then quickly seduces the girl. She later interrupts the satyr holding an orgy with his three muses, and bolts in disgust. Outside she meets the professor's son, they hit it off and get married. But her desire for approval brings her back for another private lesson with the professor, and back on her back. Will she ever find the willpower to end her sessions with the manipulative professor?

Scene 4: Ennio the pizza-maker is hot to make it with young Drena, a virginal girl whose mother warns her repeatedly about going all the way. One evening they're into some heavy petting in Ennio's car when it accidentally slips out of gear, crashes into a wall, and causes Ennio to inadvertently penetrate little Drena's holy of holies. What the heck -- might as well enjoy it! ""Whats done is done!""

Scene 5: Otto Hicks is a private dick. He's entertaining Margit (Eva Gross), his partner's wife, when his partner unexpectedly returns with a client. As Hicks and Margit watch from the safety of a handy storage closet, Oskar enthusiastically interviews his new client -- until Hick's wife (Judith Fritsch) makes an untimely appearance! Into the closet with the client -- just in time for Mrs. Hicks to mount Oskar. Since his wife is banging away in the other room, Otto figures he might as well make use of the willing woman he's closeted with. Unfortunately, their vigorous love-making alerts Mrs. Hicks, and the jig's up for everyone! To add insult to injury, their willing new client is a professional masseuse, and her bill for the office visit comes in at a cool 1.000 Marks!

And above that he is stunned to watch her own mother die of VD. He takes a vow that he would join a medical college, qualify himself as a doctor and dedicate himself for the cause of eradication of sex ignorance. But his father, Seth Jamna Prasad would not agree. There follows a tussle between the father and the son and Dinesh has to bid goodbye to his home for ever. He stands on his own legs, joins one Medical College, learns different lectures on all varied sex subjects, from Reproductive Organs to Development of Foetus. He also goes abroad for studying Psycho-Somatic treatment. Eventually, he establishes his own sex clinic and earns high repute in a short time, by treating all kinds of sexual abnormalities successfully.

In contrast, Doctor Sarkar is a quack, money-spinner, a cheat, prospering on the innocence of his patients. But as the practice of Dr. Dinesh increases, his income falls sharply. He engages the services of his accomplice Chanchal to plan a plot to involve Dinesh in an offence of rape. But finally the truth comes out in true colours and it is Doctor Sarkar who is handcuffed.

Whereas, Chanchal is mischievous girl of the story trying to trap patients for Doctor Sarkar. Radhia is the maidservant of Dr. Dinesh whose sincerity and spirit of sacrifice go on attracting the attention of Dr. Dinesh to such an extent that finally, he decides to make her his wife, ignoring all barriers of status and reaction of the Society.

Mr. & Mrs. Bhargava is a philanthropic couple. It is Seth Bhargava who helped Dinesh at every stage for his education. Dinesh was obliged. How could he repay the debt? Seth Bhargava had no issue, though he was married eight years back. Dinesh applied his knowledge of Gynaecology and Mrs. Bhargava became pregnant. But that was not enough. On the day of delivery, a climax ensued. All the specialists of the city failed to execute the delivery. It was the most complicated case. Here again, Doctor Dinesh applied his psycho-somatic treatment which resulted in easy delivery and safe birth of a baby.
