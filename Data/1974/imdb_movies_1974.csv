As a minor, the boy must be returned to his father and step-mother who live in Paris. Paul is sent to England to go to school. Upon completion of his graduation from prep school with honors (""all the prizes""), Paul begins to search for Michelle, learning from her cousin that Michelle had to take refuge in a nunnery. Paul visits with one of the nuns there, Sister Mercier, and quickly finds out that Michelle was placed in a Pâtisserie owned by Monsieur Bellancourt in Nice where Paul subsequently discovers she lived and worked for about six months... then one day, Michelle suddenly walked out. Advised by a fellow employee who has seen Michelle in the market place the week before, Paul learns that Michelle is still in Nice. After a series of near-misses, Paul eventually finds Michelle who has begun a life of her own with an older man, Garry, an airline pilot, and yet, Paul ultimately succeeds in rekindling their love. Garry departs for a job in New York and Paul and Michelle resettle in Paris. Paul's father who considers Michelle a tramp and his son a fool, cuts off Paul's allowance. This plunges Paul and Michelle into dire financial straits where they both must work menial jobs while Paul must attend classes at the university as well, all the while raising Sylvie. Both of them exhausted, the lovers quarrel about Paul's ability to remain faithful. In addition, Michelle must face having an unexpected abortion. It becomes clear that Michelle and Sylvie must go back to the Camargue so Paul can go it alone to the Sorbonne to acquire a degree and the necessary financial means.

To calm the jittery Anja, Peter relates a series of erotic stories to put her back in the mood:

Scene 1: Ingrid (Ulrike Butz) is hanging out with her friends at a bar, gets a bit drunk and picks up by a fast-moving Lothario who deflowers her. Although she regrets her first-time choice, she's now obsessed with getting enjoyment from sex. A series of men prove unable to satisfy her, but when her friend Lilo (Puppa Armbruster) drops in for a sleep-over, she finally experiences the physical release shes been seeking! Not yet ready to give up on men, Ingrid initiates our inexperienced protagonist, Peter, and finds him to be a considerate and satisfying lover.

Scene 2: Next is a lederhosen tale involving the buxom Maria (Jane Iwanoff) who is having it off with her beau, Toni, when they're interrupted by her grandfather. Toni wants to make an honest woman of Maria -- but his father is against it. Wiley old gramps knows Aloisius is boffing all the wives in town, including Maria's mother (Elke Deuringer). He and Toni don't have to wait long to catch him in the act, and blackmail him into approving the union.

Scene 3: Professor Staudinger conducts an art class in which one of his students shows promise, so he invites her to a private class in which he poses nude, then quickly seduces the girl. She later interrupts the satyr holding an orgy with his three muses, and bolts in disgust. Outside she meets the professor's son, they hit it off and get married. But her desire for approval brings her back for another private lesson with the professor, and back on her back. Will she ever find the willpower to end her sessions with the manipulative professor?

Scene 4: Ennio the pizza-maker is hot to make it with young Drena, a virginal girl whose mother warns her repeatedly about going all the way. One evening they're into some heavy petting in Ennio's car when it accidentally slips out of gear, crashes into a wall, and causes Ennio to inadvertently penetrate little Drena's holy of holies. What the heck -- might as well enjoy it! ""Whats done is done!""

Scene 5: Otto Hicks is a private dick. He's entertaining Margit (Eva Gross), his partner's wife, when his partner unexpectedly returns with a client. As Hicks and Margit watch from the safety of a handy storage closet, Oskar enthusiastically interviews his new client -- until Hick's wife (Judith Fritsch) makes an untimely appearance! Into the closet with the client -- just in time for Mrs. Hicks to mount Oskar. Since his wife is banging away in the other room, Otto figures he might as well make use of the willing woman he's closeted with. Unfortunately, their vigorous love-making alerts Mrs. Hicks, and the jig's up for everyone! To add insult to injury, their willing new client is a professional masseuse, and her bill for the office visit comes in at a cool 1.000 Marks!
