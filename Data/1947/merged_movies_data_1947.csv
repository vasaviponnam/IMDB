During the stopover, notorious criminal Fred Hawkins is murdered and the two are charged with the crime. They are quickly tried, convicted, and sentenced to die by hanging. The head of the local citizens' committee, Jim Simpson (William Ching), recalls a law whereby the survivor of a gun duel must take responsibility for the deceased's debts and family. The law spares the two from execution, but Chester is now responsible for the widow Hawkins (Marjorie Main) and her seven children. They go to her farm, where she works Chester from dawn to dusk, and at night he must work at the saloon to repay Hawkins' debt to its owner, Jake Frame (Gordon Jones). Her plan is to wear Chester down until he agrees to marry her. Chester quickly learns that no one will harm him, for fear that they will need to support Mrs. Hawkins and her family. Simpson makes Chester the sheriff hoping that fear of him will help clean up the lawless town. For protection, Chester carries around a photograph of Mrs. Hawkins and her kids. The approach works for a while, and Chester is heralded as a hero. Meanwhile, Duke still plans to go to California and tries to get Judge Benbow (George Cleveland) to marry Mrs. Hawkins to free him and Chester from their obligations. He starts a rumor that Mrs. Hawkins is about to become rich once the railroad buys her land to lay tracks. The rumor spreads quickly, and everyone tries to kill Chester hoping to marry Mrs. Hawkins(and share, or manage, her expected fortune). Frame eventually confesses to Hawkins' murder; Duke and Chester are cleared and allowed to leave town, but not before they admit that they fabricated the railroad rumor. Benbow still wants to marry Mrs. Hawkins, and she agrees. She then announces that the railroad actually did offer her substantial money, and she is now wealthy.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0039998/?ref_=sr_i_201,"['Robert Lees', 'Frederic I.

489. The Hal Roach Comedy Carnival,1947,1h 52m,Approved,7.3,13,,"To quote a Marine D.I. in San Diego or John Wayne in several movies, ""Listen up, we ain't going to plow this ground twice."" In 1947, Hal Roach made a film called ""Curley"", which was an expanded version of 1930's ""Our Gang"" short ""Teacher's Pet"", with Frances Rafferty and Larry Olsen taking the roles played by June Marlowe and Jackie Cooper in the original short. Hal Roach also made a film called ""The Fabulous Joe"", basically about a drunk, a talking dog, gangsters and Marie Wilson running around in her skivvies. The two films, intended as bottom-half of a double feature, were released about two weeks apart, with ""Curley"" going out first. ""The Fabulous Joe"" came about two weeks later. At the same time, the two films were stitched together and offered, with the combined running time of 112 minutes, to exhibitors who didn't play double features. The film listed on this page, ""Hal Roach's Comedy Carnival"", is the result. ""Curley"" was an attempt by Hal Roach, who no longer owned the rights to ""Our Gang"" (aka ""The Little Rascals"") to create a version of ""Our Gang"" with a new set of kids, which would be known as ""Curley and His Gang"", and would be feature-length films in Cinecolor. ""Curley"" was the first one in the series and was followed in 1948 by ""Who Killed ""Doc"" Robbin"" with the same kids from ""Curley"" playing the same roles. Later, ""Curley"" and ""Who Killed 'Doc' Robbin"" were packaged together as ""The Adventures of Curley and His Gang"" for theatres and later sold to televising, and there are sources who keep adding the adult cast from the ""Doc Robbin"" film (Don Castle, Virginia Grey, Claire DuBrey, Paul Hurst and others)incorrectly to the cast of ""Curley."" The fun part of ""Hal Roach's Comedy Carnival"" is that it is comprised of two films that are about as opposite of each other as films can be. ""The Fabulous Joe"" is a screwball comedy filled with double entendre dialogue and scenes and as ""Adult"" as a film of the 40's could be and still get PCA approval. ""Curley"", as mentioned, is ""Our Gang"" updated and in color.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0039443/?ref_=sr_i_489,"['Arnold Belgard', 'Dorothy Davenport', 'Jack Jevne']","['Bernard Carr', 'Harve Foster']","['Frances Rafferty', 'Larry Olsen', 'Eilene Janssen', 'Dale Belding', 'Peter Miles', 'Ardda Lynwood', 'Kathleen Howard', 'Edna Holland', 'Rene Beard', 'Donald King']",,,,,"August 29, 1947",['United States'],"['Hal Roach Studios - 8822 Washington Blvd., Culver City, California, USA (Studio)']",['Hal Roach Studios'],,['Comedy'],['English']

Louisiana,1947,1h 25m,Approved,7.0,30,,"Fourteen-year-old James Houston Davis, the music-loving son of a poor sharecropper, is determined to get a good education and help improve life in his beloved state of Louisiana. With help from his self-sacrificing parents, Jimmie graduates from Beech Springs High School and is accepted at Louisiana College. After financing his way through college by working odd jobs and selling songs he has written, Jimmie graduates with a B.A. and returns to teach at Beech Springs High. The next year he enrolls at Louisiana State University and earns his Master's degree. He becomes a history and social-sciences professor at the all-female Dodd College in Shreveport, where he meets Charlie Mitchell, a jazz-band leader who recognizes Jimmie's musical talent and tricks him into agreeing to sing one of his songs on his radio show. Sure that Jimmie will be a hit, Charlie connives to increase the small station's broadcast range, and Jimmie's performance is heard all the way to Alaska. Jimmie's singing is also heard at Dodd, and the college's understanding but traditional president, Dr. M. E. Dodd, reluctantly asks Jimmie to choose between teaching and music. Urged by both Charlie and Alvern Adams, an intelligent young woman whom Charlie has introduced to Jimmie, to pursue his singing career, Jimmie resigns from Dodd. Jimmie marries Alvern soon after, and while still singing and composing, he takes a job as the court clerk of Shreveport. He is then asked to run for police commissioner of Shreveport. Although Jimmie is wary of entering politics, Alvern persuades him that he is the best man for the job. Uncomfortable with speech-making, Jimmie sings with his band during his rallies and easily wins the election. Immediately afterward, Tomlins, a Shreveport racketeer, tries to bribe Jimmie into allowing him to continue his illegal gaming activities, but Jimmie refuses. Jimmie then leads a series of raids against Tomlins, and the racketeer is eventually sentenced to a two-year prison term. His leadership abilities recognized, Jimmie is asked to run as the state's public service commissioner--and wins. At the same time, Jimmie and Charlie's tune ""You Are My Sunshine"" is recorded by Bing Crosby and becomes a nationwide hit. To celebrate Jimmie's hefty royalty check, Jimmie, Alvern, and Charlie, who is now Jimmie's campaign manager, go to an elegant restaurant in New Orleans, where Jimmie is approached by political boss Fred Astor. Astor and the state political machine offer Jimmie the nomination for governor, as well as $100,000, but Jimmie, fearing corruption, declines the offer. Alvern urges Jimmie to run for governor as an independent, but he refuses, sure he would be defeated by Astor's machine and refuses. Alvern's disappointment in his decision causes Jimmie to return home to Beech Springs and seek the advice of his father. After Mr. Davis counsels his son to run for governor if he desires the honor of the office more than the greed, Jimmie announces his candidacy. As Jimmie grows more and more popular around the state, Astor and his candidate, Leonard Herman, grow more and more nervous. Hoping to find something scandalous from his past, Astor orders an investigation into Jimmie's background. When the search yields nothing, Herman plays an old, somewhat risque' record of Jimmie's, ""Bang, Bang,"" during one of his rallies. Instead of being outraged by the song, the crowd cheers and starts dancing to the music. The day of the election is plagued by severe rainstorms, and Jimmie, whose main support is in the state's rural areas, fears defeat. Despite the inclement weather, Jimmie's supporters make their way to the polls, and Jimmie wins by a landslide.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0039584/?ref_=sr_i_537,"['Jack DeWitt', 'Steve Healey', 'Scott Darling']",['Phil Karlson'],"['Jimmie Davis', 'Margaret Lindsay', 'John Gallaudet', 'Freddie Stewart', 'Dottye Brown', 'Ralph Reed', 'Russell Hicks', ""Lee 'Lasses' White"", 'John Harmon', 'Tristram Coffin']",,,,,"November 15, 1947",['United States'],,['Lindsley Parsons Productions'],,['Drama'],['English']

In 1869, Nikolai Nikolaevich Miklouho-Maclay made a report in the Geographical Society about the need to study the indigenous population of the islands of Oceania. The Society Council decided to support his undertaking and, after receiving small funds, the scientist on the warship Vityaz leaves for New Guinea. Not wanting to impose his presence on the inhabitants of the village located on the shore, Nikolai Nikolayevich settles in the distance, in a house built by sailors from Vityaz for him. From now on, his goal is to understand the environment. The natives of the island knew how to build beautiful ships. The figures on the pies, on the trees on the shields were nothing more than the first manifestation of ideographic writing. The dexterity with which the natives performed various works was striking, although they were carried out by primitive tools. Miklouho-Maclay carefully recorded all the observations in a special notebook, which he kept from the first day of his stay on the island. From unusual and difficult living conditions in the rainforest, Nikolai Nikolaevich was seriously ill. It was no less difficult for his companions. The first teenager died of the fever, then the white servant Thomson, who before his death managed to admit that he had spied on the Russian scientist on behalf of Dr. Brandler. After a long absence, Miklouho-Maclay returns to Sydney. Margarita Robertson, whom he married after seven years of separation, becomes his faithful companion and assistant in scientific work. The penetration of the German Association in the South Seas to New Guinea and the active participation of its representative, Dr. Brandler, made Miklouho-Maclay take a tough stance. He will face a difficult struggle for the recognition of his point of view, which was formed in the course of work with material accumulated over many years of travel.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0040972/?ref_=sr_i_566,"['Aleksei Speshnyov', 'Vladimir Volkenshtein', 'V.
