His heiress daughter is soon to be wed to Foster Harvey, who believes she's a cold, unfeeling woman, despite loving her. Her cold emotional state is in large part due to leading a restricted life. A low level thug named Johnny overhears their secret wedding night plans, and peddles the idea of robbing her of the $100,000 worth of diamond jewelry with which she will be adorned to two groups of his gangster acquaintances, who are in competition with each other. The robbery doesn't go quite according to plan, with Miss Blandish ultimately being kidnapped and held under the eye of Slim Grisson, the heir apparent as head of the violent Grisson gang, currently run by Ma Grisson. Kidnapping holds higher risk but possible greater reward as everyone figures they can get at least $1 million for her. Ma has no plans of letting her go, killing her after getting the money. But a surprise move by Slim, who has a secret past with Miss Blandish, turns the tables on the kidnapping and in turn Miss Blandish's emotional state. She ends up falling in love with him, and he with her.

Kitty, the brothers' secretary, is secretly in love with Phil, but Phil is smitten with June. Following the benefit party, Kitty visits Phil and Freddie's mother, who lives alone in an East Side tenement, and asks her to help stop the bickering between her sons. Mrs. Russo tells Kitty that she has refused to play favorite with either son, and that she has turned down separate invitations from Phil and Freddie to live with them.

You and I feel these circumstances every day, every hour, every minute and every second, so much so that they rule the strings of our feelings, sentiments and actions. We simply can not avoid them. . Bindiya, the innocent, simple, active yet charming young girl used to stay in a hut and maintained her living by selling flowers. She used to pluck her flowers from the garden created by Nature on the bank of the rippling river. It was adorned by the ruins of the ancient palace. The scanty shadows designed by the sunbeams on the cracked floor of the palace and the reflections of the crystal clear water on the broken walls bounded by the luxuriant growth of the flowers made it an ideal spot. Ashok a young dreamer, a thinker and a writer selected this secluded spot to inspire him to write his novel. Bindiya, thinking this handsome youth as her customer, approached him and asked him in her childlike voice,Babu, wouldnt you buy the flowers from me ?Ashok looked at her and said,No. Bindiya told him that she could not find any customer to buy her flowers on that day. Ashok felt his pockets. They were almost empty. He had hardly a two anna piece in it. He placed it in her shapely hands. Bindiya threw away the piece and said,"" What do you think I am ?"" Ashok admired her. He smiled and took from her a glowing bud of rose. She thought he was grand. She began to like him. Yes,then she began to love him. . In the meantime Bindiya while returning home, met a tramp who used to take away her earning. He began to harass her. She cried and shouted for help. Ashok heard her cry and ran to help her. A herculean fist of the tramp sent him reeling on the ground, depriving him of his eyesight. . the circumstances sometimes behave with us very mathematically. Bindiya took him to the nearest doctor, who was a very kindhearted social worker. He admitted him in his small hospital-which was incidentally his home-and began to treat him for his eye trouble. Ashok met Geeta the doctors daughter,refined and cultured. Her chisel carved face and the graceful body impressed him as an angel of sublimity and beauty. In the absence of her father, she nursed his physique and soul. She sang a song which inspired Ashok to work on his novel. . The circumstances play the game of chess in mans life. Ashok thought of his weakness of economic condition and felt it too bad to visit Geeta. He resolved to meet her after getting sufficiently rich to stand with her family on the same level. He began to work on his novel with vigorous spirit and enthusiasm. . He often met Bindiya while he was writing his novel on the river bank. He liked to talk to her and listened to her innocent, lovely, chirping voice. She imagined the world too beautiful. . He liked her for her fancies and dreams. She loved him sincerely, truly. She thought he also loved her. Ashok loved Geeta, the paragon of beauty, culture and learning. Sometimes circustances play the game of hide and seek with human beings. Once Bindiya and Geeta met at the river bank. They went sentimental over theirboy. Their emotions clashed. There was a mighty storm in their hearts. Ultimately,Sublimity gave way to Innocence. . But the fate calculated their lives to be different. Ashok loved Geeta. He liked Bindiya but never loved her. But Geeta had given him up and had never shown a sign of remembering him. Once she very politely turned him out of her house. Ashok was flabbergasted, stunned. He couldnt read his future. It was all darkness. . The circustances were playing with him. They were responsible for many tears and blood. They alone can determine the shape of the lives of Bindiya, Geeta and Ashok.

Soon after arriving in Kilmer County, Duke meets newspaper editor Matt Brady and Matt's attractive daughter Julie. Julie tells Duke that there is plenty of oil under Kilmer County but that no one has dug deep enough to find it. Though Julie is Tex's old sweetheart, Duke pursues a romance with her. Julie later rejects Tex's marriage proposal, telling him that she does not want to marry an oil man or a newspaperman like her father because they live unsettled, transient lives. Always searching for a way to make an easy profit, Duke devises a plan to fleece the people of Kilmer by having them invest in oil drilling that is unlikely to yield oil. After drilling for several days without striking oil, Duke declares the well dry and makes preparations to leave town with the remainder of the investors' money. Tex, however, refuses to abandon the project without fulfilling his obligation to the people of Kilmer, and insists on digging another thousand feet. Tex demands that Duke turn over his share of the money to complete the drilling, and a fistfight ensues when Duke accuses Tex of using the drilling to impress Julie and win her affections. Duke leaves town for West Texas, but Julie, who is in love with Duke, follows him and offers to marry him. Julie and Duke wed, while Duke earns little money building wells in West Texas, Tex and Delbert, who have continued their digging in Kilmer, strike oil. Later, Julie realizes that Duke has been abusive to her because he is too proud to accept money from her and is uncomfortable with newly acquired oil wealth. Months later, Julie gives birth to baby boy, and Duke finally strikes oil, making him a millionaire. When the governor of Texas and other legislators meet at Duke's house to discuss oil matters, Duke persuades them that it is time to create laws that will force all oil producers to pro-rate the amount of oil they take from each well. Though he does not reveal his motives to the legislators, Duke knows that such a law will badly hurt Tex. Tex, however, decides to disobey the new law and continue producing oil at full capacity. Many independent oil drillers resort to violence against the state oil inspectors in order to keep their wells running. Julie leaves Duke when the militia is sent to Kilmer as a result of Duke's heartlessness in enforcing the law. Duke eventually realizes his foolishness, and goes to Kilmer to settle his differences with Tex. Duke and Tex engage in a bruising hand-to-hand fight, then having cleared the air, resume their friendship.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0040845/?ref_=sr_i_477,"['Francis Rosenwald', 'Henry J.

Late one night, Gila finds Jakoll in her room preparing to kill her, but her screams frighten him away. A short time later, Paolo tells Leslie that his niece, Helena Guistano, who resembles Gila, and Helena's father Mario were Nazi collaborators.

Later, Leslie and Paolo take Gila to the Daghla Café, and Bunny notices the similarity between Gila and Helena, but when he tries to tell Carlo, the club owner, he realizes that Carlo is one of Mario's men.

For instance, the film's Director Chano Urueta ( who became an acclaimed actor in his own right), actually co-wrote the script along with one of its principal actresses, namely Esther Fernandez, as well as adding in the literary abilities of a well-known movie-producer of the era named Luis Marique. As such, its is somewhat ironic the final co- writer who contributed to this joint-effort was actually its only full-time, professional writer, (and best-selling Novelist at the time), author Jose Maria Carretero. In fact, by all accounts, the original idea for this movie was loosely based on his book, entitled ""El Caballero Audaz"" . It is also interesting to note that in this particular film, it was decided that actor Jose Pulido's singing voice was to be uncharacteristically ""dubbed-over"" and replaced by that of falsetto crooner Miguel Aceves Mejia, who is credited as ""the voice"" but does not otherwise visually appear on film at an.y time during this 1 hour and 25 minute movie.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0223117/?ref_=sr_i_562,"['José María Carretero', 'Esther Fernández', 'Luis Manrique']",['Chano Urueta'],"['Miguel Aceves Mejía', 'Victorio Blanco', 'Lupe Carriles', 'Yolanda del Valle', 'Esther Fernández', 'Pascual García Peña', 'Alfonso Jiménez', 'Cecilia Leger', 'Francisco Llopis', 'Paco Martínez']",,,,,"July 9, 1948",['Mexico'],['Mexico'],,,['Drama'],['Spanish']

Ramji, along with an army of apes and bears, descends upon Lanka, kills Ravan's brother, Khumbakaran; while Hanumanji resurrects Lakshman, who was fatally wounded by Meghnath.
