421. After Auschwitz,2017,1h 23m,,7.3,141,74,"""You're free. Go home"" Most Holocaust films end with these words, the very words that survivors heard at liberation. After Auschwitz begins with these words, inviting audiences to experience what happened next. For survivors, liberation from the camps was the beginning of a life long struggle. They wanted to go home, but there was no home left in Europe. They came to America and wanted to tell people about their pasts but were silenced for over three decades. ""You're in America now, put it behind you"". After Auschwitz is a ""Post-Holocaust"" documentary that captures what it means to survive and try to life a normal life after unspeakable tragedy. Six extraordinary women who all survived Auschwitz take us on a journey that American audiences have never seen before. These women all moved to Los Angeles, married, raised children and became ""Americans"" but they never truly found a place to call home. What makes the story so much more fascinating is how these women saw, interpreted and interacted with the changing face of America in the second half of the 20th century. They serve as our guides on an unbelievable journey, sometimes celebratory, sometimes heart breaking but always inspiring. It is also the only ""Holocaust"" film that includes Ricardo Montalban, George W. Bush and an appearance at The Kennedy Center Honors. After Auschwitz gives us the story that we have always wanted to see and one that in many ways is as important as the stories of the camps themselves.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6079976/?ref_=sr_i_421
