His companion, the vain Elder Van Pelt, seeks to become the assistant to the mission president (the top post available) as soon as possible, and he receives letters from three girlfriends he left behind. The capable Elder Rogers has become disillusioned and inattentive to his duties ever since a previous missionary companion returned to America, looked up and married Elder Rogers' girlfriend. As a result he is simply marking time until he returns home in a few weeks time. The three meet Elder Rogers' new companion, Elder Calhoun, in the train station. This new elder is a nerdy but enthusiastic ""greenie"" that has just arrived from the Missionary Training Center (MTC) in Utah. Unfortunately his training did not give him much fluency in the Dutch language, but as luck would have it, the first person he approaches to proselytize is a fellow American named Kyle. In the weeks that come, Elder Johnson and Van Pelt increasingly irritate each other while in contrast Elder Rogers and Calhoun begin to relate in a positive fashion as they teach Kyle about the Mormon faith.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0377038/?ref_=sr_i_214,['Scott S.

The Nomi Song,2004,1h 38m,Not Rated,7.4,1.1K,71.0,"Having failed to break into professional opera in his native Germany (where, as an usher in West Berlin's Deutsche Oper, he would serenade the staff after the real performances were over) the diminutive Klaus Nomi headed for NYC in 1972. The vibrant New Wave/avant-garde gestalt of the mid/late '70's East Village proved to be fertile ground for the development of his unique talents. Working by day as a high-end pastry chef, Nomi began to stage his outlandish performances, first launching himself upon an unsuspecting public at the New Wave Vaudeville in 1978. The hip and cynical young audience was stunned by this weird combination of falsetto arias, booming classical orchestration, Kraftwerk-style electronica, futuristic costumes and outer space imagery. An odd assortment of artists, choreographers, designers, songwriters and musicians jumped on to the Nomi bandwagon and the phenomenon began to take off - first attracting thousands to South Manhattan events (including performances at the legendary Max's Kansas City) and culminating in a recording contract with the French division of RCA. With the release 'Klaus Nomi' in 1981 and 'Simple Man' in 1982, it looked as if Nomi was on the verge of superstardom. Having established himself in Europe, he made a triumphant return to New York City. But Nomi's moment of glory proved to be his swansong. Within only a few months Nomi had succumbed to the ravages of AIDS. One of the first celebrities to be killed by this mysterious new disease, Nomi died a lonely death, largely abandoned by those who had seen him as a passport to their own success. Today, the otherworldliness of 'The Cold Song' and 'Dido's Lament' is like an ethereal voice calling from beyond the grave.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0402406/?ref_=sr_i_360,['Andrew Horn'],['Andrew Horn'],"['Klaus Nomi', 'Ann Magnuson', 'David Bowie', 'Gabriele Lafari', 'David McDermott', 'Page Wood', 'Tony Frere', 'Man Parrish', 'Kristian Hoffman', 'Ron Johnsen']",,"$14,510","$74,631","$74,631","March 24, 2005",['Germany'],"['Los Angeles, California, USA']","['ARTE', 'CV Films', 'Cameo Filmproduktion']","Awards, 1 win & 1 nomination total","['Biography', 'Documentary', 'Music']","['English', 'German']"

They are also encouraged to pass the cameras along to get as many Iraqis across the country to participate in this project as possible. The cameras are in circulation from April to September 2004, shortly after the American bombing of Fallujah and the fall of the dictatorial regime of Saddam Hussein; the resulting footage was compiled to become this film. Most of the subjects talk about issues around Hussein versus the Americans, and whether their lives and of Iraqis in general are better off now or then, their thoughts about democracy in general and how it applies to Iraq, and what they want to see for their future. A few also steer clear of politics altogether, wanting to focus on happier things. As the cameras move around the country, regional differences emerge, such as the Kurds of the north, who were persecuted by Hussein, having a unique perspective. Differences also emerge based on individual exposure to Hussein and/or his associates, or to what recently occurred in Fallujah. This digital camera footage is interspersed with other videos, including propaganda video by jihadis, and found unofficial videos recorded by Hussein's regime documenting their actions while in power, and with western media headlines about the Iraqi situation which has largely shaped the western view of life in Iraq.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0430745/?ref_=sr_i_372,['People of Iraq'],"['People of Iraq', 'Martin Kunert']",['People of Iraq'],,"$30,634","$57,999","$57,999","October 29, 2004","['United States', 'Iraq']",['Iraq'],"['Booya Studios', 'Voices of Freedom LLC']",,"['Documentary', 'War']","['Arabic', 'English', 'Kurdish']"

Pola Rapaport explores Aury's inspiration, recreating the world of '50s literary Paris and setting it against dramatic sequences that bring the infamous book to life. The author and various French intellectuals expound on the thorny relationship between sexuality and power, submission and freedom, liberation and non-being.

Twelve-year-old Koichi has grown up within the confines of a religious cult whose violently instilled dogma has all but destroyed his sense of identity. After a murderous attack, the cult disbands and Koichi finds himself abandoned by his mother and forcibly separated from his sister. To reunite his broken family, Koichi breaks out of the child welfare system and sets off to Tokyo. While on the run, he meets Yuki, a girl desperate to flee from her abusive father. 

Koichi and Yuki travel together in search of his sister, facing the inevitable troubles of children making their way in the world without the guidance or protection of adults. The separate scars of their pasts cause friction between the two, but their struggles develop a familial bond that allows them to confront both their pasts and the future ahead. 

Beautiful and poignant, Akihiko Shiota's film illustrates the resiliency of forgotten youth in forging their own destiny from a tragic past.
