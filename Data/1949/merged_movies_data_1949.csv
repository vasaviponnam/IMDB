This was Edward Dmytryk's first film after he had refused to tell a Congressional Committee whether or not he was, or had ever been, a member of the Communist Party. This is a 'runaway production' shot in England for political reasons and not for the usual USA tax-break reasons. Geremio, a young Italian immigrant to New York City, works as a bricklayer and is courting an Italian girl, Annunziata, by mail. He lies to her that he owns his own home and, after they are married, has to rent one for their three-day honeymoon. The years pass and they are unable to save enough money to get out of their slum tenement, and the 1929 depression brings even harder times to the family that now includes three children. Geremio, in order to make enough money to care for his family, exploits his ""comrades"" in dangerous construction work. This practice leads to the accidental death of his best friend, and, in grief, Geremio also becomes unfaithful to his wife. The messages of the film -- life is aimless and no man can judge the true worth of another man -- are pounded on for most of the two-hour running time.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0041416/?ref_=sr_i_239,"['Pietro Di Donato', 'Ben Barzman', 'John Penn']",['Edward Dmytryk'],"['Sam Wanamaker', 'Lea Padovani', 'Kathleen Ryan', 'Bonar Colleano', 'Charles Goldner', 'Sidney James', 'Karel Stepanek', 'William Sylvester', 'Rosalie Crutchley', 'George Pastell']","$500,000 (estimated)",,,,"July 21, 1950",['United Kingdom'],"['Denham Studios, Denham, Buckinghamshire, England, UK']",['Plantagenet'],"Awards, 1 win & 1 nomination total",['Drama'],['English']

She goes to a jeweler named Charles Winters, who offers her $1,000 for the ring, much more than it is worth. After Gloria leaves with the money, Winters quickly burns the sales receipt, ransacks the shop and phones the police to report that his shop has been robbed. When Gloria returns to the train station, an investigator is waiting to arrest her. At the police station, Gloria is placed in jail after they find the money Winters had given her for the ring. A short time later, Winters pays off a three-hundred dollar debt to mob boss Joe Sapelli, stating that he received the money as payment from his insurance company for the robbery. Joe suspects that Winters has framed Gloria, so he decides to post her $10,000 bail. Before she is discharged, District Attorney James Deveron insists she help him break up Joe's syndicate, threatening to tell her family about the charges if she refuses. Deveron gives her the money that Joe has left for her, but when she meets Joe for dinner that evening, she returns it and asks him for a job instead. Later, when the vice squad raids Joe's bookmaking operation, some of his men are arrested, but Joe, who had been forewarned by the corrupt Lt. Metzger and Capt. E. V. Roberts.

347. Red Stallion in the Rockies,1949,1h 25m,Approved,5.0,43,,"One night in the Colorado Rockies, Dynamite, a wild stallion, escapes from a corral and joins a herd of wild horses. The next day, Thad Avery and Talky Carson, two out-of-work circus performers, are driving their circus wagon down a country road and, spotting the wild horses in the distance, talk about catching and training one of the herd. Meanwhile, on the Honeymoon Ranch, young Cindy Smith is feeding some animals while her grandfather, Matthew Simpson, castigates Dave Ryder, his nephew and foreman, for shirking his duties by claiming he has strained his back. Martha, Cindy's grandmother, has made her a colorful dress for a dance, but Matthew, who is very strict with Cindy due to her deceased mother's rebellious youth, disapproves of it. Later, Matthew hires Thad and Talky, who are anxious to finance their return to Chicago, to help with the harvest. Neighboring rancher Andy Davis tells Matthew that the local Indians are having trouble with a herd of wild horses, led by a ghost horse who ""glows"" in the dark. Davis is concerned that his horses may be able to join the wild herd as his fences are weak, so Matthew sends Dave to ride night watch for him. Later, while Thad and Cindy get to know each other, the herd raids the Davis ranch, causing a fight between Dynamite and Davis' stallion over a mare. The next day, after Matthew and Davis try to figure out where Dave was during the commotion, Matthew returns to his ranch and finds Dave signing up migrant workers. Furious, Matthew gets into a fistfight with Dave and when the harvest begins, the humiliated Dave plans revenge against Matthew. After placing rocks in Matthew's jacket, Dave has Cindy's pet elk, Hannibal, sniff it, then beats him with it. Meanwhile, Matthew again forbids Cindy from going to a dance but Martha defiantly makes her a dress from circus costumes that Thad supplies. At the dance, Cindy and Thad dance while Talky sets up a dice game using crooked dice. Dave breaks in on the dancing couple, saying that the sheriff is aware of Talky's game and is confiscating his winnings. As Dave and Cindy dance, Matthew and Davis show up, and Matthew orders Cindy to wait for him in his truck. Just then, Martha runs in with news that the wild herd has wrecked their ranch, and is headed toward town. As Dynamite leads the herd past the hall, Talky realizes that Dynamite is his former circus horse who supposedly died in a fire. Although Thad protests that Dynamite was a red stallion, Talky says that he had applied phosphorescent paint to the animal just before the fire. A thousand dollar reward is offered for shooting the stallion and, after Matthew fires Thad and Talky, they decide to try to save the horse. Matthew then informs Cindy that, against Martha's wishes, he intends to send her to a missionary school in Denver. In the mountains, Thad and Talky find Dynamite being stalked by Dave and others. Talky whistles to the horse and as he approaches, Dave shoots at him but hits Thad in the arm instead. Thad puts his saddle on Dynamite and they ride off, escaping from Dave. Later, Judge Hardy, reacting to Dave's account of the events, orders a road block. However, Cindy finds her way to Thad and Talky's camp, where Talky has removed the paint from Dynamite with oil, and she is introduced to ""The World's Greatest Circus Horse."" When Talky tells Cindy that they want to wire an agent in Chicago to request bookings, she offers to send the wire and bring the response. Thad invites Cindy to join them on the circus circuit, but they all have to leave hurriedly when Dave approaches. Later, as Cindy prepares to take Thad a telegram advising them that they are to open in Denver, Martha shows her an old newspaper clipping about her mother Laura, who at Cindy's age, ran away to join a theatrical company. Laura returned to the ranch to give birth to Cindy, then died. After Martha tells Cindy that her mother was happy and that she wants the same for her, she gives her blessing to Cindy to go with Thad. Later, when some mares try to lure Dynamite back to the wild, Cindy offers to hide him in an empty barn on the ranch. Meanwhile, Dave has again been hitting Hannibal with Matthew's rock-filled jacket. Dave discovers Dynamite and lays claim to him, but Matthew will not let him have the horse, stating that the community must decide his fate. After Matthew goes back inside the house, Dave frees Hannibal from the corral, then calls for Matthew to come out. Matthew does not want to face Dave again, so Martha puts on his jacket against the chill air and finds Hannibal loose. When Martha uses the jacket to shoo Hannibal back to the corral, the elk reacts to the hated jacket and attacks her. Cindy runs out and attempts to distract Hannibal while Matthew tends to Martha. Dynamite breaks free from Dave and attacks Hannibal when he goes after the old couple. Hannibal gores the horse, but Dynamite fights back. After a long struggle, Dynamite forces the elk to run off. Just then, Thad and Talky arrive in their wagon, calm Dynamite and give Martha first aid. Later, as Martha recovers, Matthew, at last coming to terms with the loss of Laura, gives his blessing to Cindy joining the circus. Hannibal joins Cindy, Thad, Talky and Dynamite as they head for Denver and the circus.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0041794/?ref_=sr_i_347,"['Tom Reed', 'Francis Rosenwald']",['Ralph Murphy'],"['Arthur Franz', 'Wallace Ford', 'Ray Collins', 'Jean Heather', 'Jim Davis', 'Leatrice Joy', 'James Kirkwood', 'Gustino Loyal', 'Dynamite', 'John Doucette']",,,,,"May 2, 1949",['United States'],"['Universal Studios - 100 Universal City Plaza, Universal City, California, USA (Studio)']",['Aubrey Schenck Productions'],,"['Adventure', 'Drama', 'Western']",['English']

Big-shot gambler Tony Russo agrees to underwrite the challenger's cut and to take care of the publicity. Tony hires a fast-talking press agent, Terry Shea, to build Jimmy up as the favorite, with the intention of cashing in on what he believes will be Bronski's certain victory.

Jane Cunningham, Chester's younger daughter, suspects something is up and enlists the aid of her fellow reporter, ""Ace"" Martin. They pay a call on Tony and ""Ace"" threatens to blast him in the press. But before he can, Tony has him blasted in the alley.

After Dixie invites Jimmie to perform in a concert he is putting on for the other passengers, Jimmie is persuaded to participate in a crooked card game run by Judge Homer Kenworthy and his associates. However, with Dixie's intervention, Jimmie wins handsomely, then accuses the gamblers of trying to cheat him. A fistfight breaks out and Jimmie beats them. When the boat docks at Creek City, Jimmie is disturbed to see Kenworthy and his cohorts welcomed by Stan Caldwell, Jimmie's uncle's partner, and Jeanette, who runs the Round-Up Saloon. Jimmie decides to take a job with the Sunshine Band, which has been booked at the saloon, in order to find out more about Caldwell. After town developer Caldwell installs Kenworthy as judge, and his associate, Samuel W. Beale, as city marshal, Jimmie discovers that his uncle was killed during a purported holdup and suspects that Caldwell was behind it. He also finds out that Caldwell has been cheating the settlers by selling them dry land and forcing them to buy water from him. Then, when they cannot pay, Caldwell forecloses and resells the land. Still not revealing who he really is, Jimmie challenges Caldwell about a claim belonging to Pop Lassiter. As a result, Caldwell tells Jeanette to pay Jimmie off, but Jimmie turns her down. After Jimmie discovers that Caldwell's men have roughed up Pop, he confronts Caldwell and reveals that he is his partner. Caldwell offers to buy Jimmie out, but he refuses to sell. Jeanette, who is falling in love with Jimmie, warns him to beware of Caldwell. As Caldwell controls the town's lawmen, Jimmie plans to incorporate the town and hold an election to fill the posts. He stages a minstrel show to enlist the support of the citizens and the judge's eighteen-year-old daughter Dorothy, who has just arrived in town, becomes part of the show. During the performance, Jimmie urges the audience to incorporate the town and elect their own officials, but is interrupted by gunfire from Caldwell's men, who try to break up the event. Jimmie tells Dorothy that her father is involved in Caldwell's crooked activities. On election day, Caldwell's men intimidate potential voters from entering the polling booth. Meanwhile, Jimmie rounds up the outlying land owners, who must then deal with barricades that Caldwell has set up at the entrances to the town. After Dorothy persuades her father to stand up to Caldwell, he goes to the poll and urges the citizens to vote for incorporation, but is shot at by one of Caldwell's men. However, Jimmie leads the settlers as they fight their way into town and cast their votes for a legitimate government.

Roll, Thunder, Roll!",1949,1h,Approved,6.2,43,,"In the second of the four Cinecolor ""Red Ryder"" films PRODUCED by Equity Pictures and released and DISTRIBUTED by Eagle Lion Films (USA), Red Ryder finds two silver conchas, the trademark of bandit El Conejo, at a raided ranch. He reports the raid to Marshal Bill Faugh but tells him that he suspects that El Conejo, a Robin hood type character, is being framed. El Conejo shows up at the saloon and accuses Ace Hanlon, the owner, of framing him. Red prevents El Conejo from killing Hanlon, and says he will deliver him to the Marshal. On the way, El Conejo's men captures Red and is about to be executed, but the bandit, ever the sport, gives Red a chance to defend himself. Red beats El Conejo to the draw, without shooting him, and then, since he is innocent, convinces him he will be better off in jail. Red, his friends Buckskin Blodgett and Little Beaver, his aunt, the Duchess and the Marshal's fiancé, Carole Loomis are guarding El Conejo in jail, figuring that Hanlon's gang will try to free him since they can't blame raids on him while he is in jail. Carole leaves to go home and finds her uncle, Happy Loomis, unconscious in the street after having been beaten up. She summons her friends who leave Buckskin as the sole guard in the jail. Hanlon's men overpower Buckskin, take El Conejo to a ranch, shoot and wound the rancher who sees only El Conejo, and then they let El Conejo escape. The Marshal is not happy with this turn of events, but Red and Buckskin have a foolproof plan, or as close to foolproof as anything involving an Emmett Lynn character could be.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0180105/?ref_=sr_i_563,"['Paul Franklin', 'Fred Harman']",['Lewis D.

Then Enrico, who is not dead, returns to Milan and tries to find Clara. He learns that she died the day before and sadly goes to pay his respects at the chapel where her body lies. Amazingly, Clara is not dead but in a state of catalepsy. Enrico abducts her and takes her to a convent to attempt a cure.
