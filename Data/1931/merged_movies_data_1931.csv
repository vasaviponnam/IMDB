Found unconscious with a head wound two years earlier in the streets of Washington, Alexander, now a mind reader in the act, cannot remember anything about his previous life. Beverly Lane, whose brother Paul disappeared two years earlier, listens intently to her radio, but her uncle, financier John Carrington, calls the announcement a cheap publicity stunt. When Beverly insists on going to the theater, Carrington accompanies her. Before his performance, Chatrand, upon seeing Beverly through the stage curtains, recognizes her from a picture in the locket Alexander carries. He has always wanted to meet the woman in the picture. During the act, Chatrand blindfolds Alexander and has him describe objects belonging to members of the audience and answer their questions. When Chatrand asks Alexander to describe Beverly's locket, which is identical to Alexander's, Carrington protests and struggles with Chatrand. Sonya, Chatrand's assistant, pulls a light switch. In the dark, a hand wearing a spider ring fires a gun, and Carrington falls. The police soon arrive and keep the audience from leaving, as a man from the audience, Dr. Blackstone, attends to Carrington. After Inspector Riley finds a gun beside Alexander, who is unconscious, Chatrand removes Alexander's mask. Beverly then embraces him and identifies him as her lost brother. Chatrand brings Alexander out of his trance, and upon seeing Beverly, Alexander exclaims, ""He tried to kill me; I had to do it!"" Treating this as a confession, Riley has Alexander and Beverly taken to the theater manager's office, while he keeps Chatrand under observation. Chatrand, however, escapes into a casket and then through a trap door. Alexander tells Beverly that two years earlier Carrington attempted to steal all their money, and that when Carrington tried to kill him, he fell, precipitating his amnesia. Chatrand then finds out that Carrington had been receiving telephone calls from someone who lost a great deal of money to him. When Riley learns that Carrington has died, he arrests Alexander for first-degree murder. Chatrand, however, convinces Riley to let him conduct a seance before the audience is allowed to leave to try to make the murderer betray himself. During the seance, as Chatrand's image appears before the audience, and Carrington, speaking through Chatrand, threatens to name his murderer, a shot breaks the mirror which is conveying the image. Chatrand next has Alexander, in the guise of a mind reader, attempt to ""find"" the mind of the murderer. After he reveals a number of dark secrets in the minds of some audience members, Alexander says that the murderer wears a spider ring, and he names the row in which the murderer is sitting. As he is about to reveal the murderer's seat number, a shot rings out. Dr. Blackstone, who hysterically says that Carrington deserved death for ruining a savings bank and turning his family and thousands of others into paupers, is apprehended. Chatrand, who suffered a wound to his arm, is attended to by Beverly, who has grown fond of him.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0022421/?ref_=sr_i_154,"['Fulton Oursler', 'Lowell Brentano', 'Barry Conners']","['Kenneth MacKenna', 'William Cameron Menzies']","['Edmund Lowe', 'Lois Moran', 'El Brendel', 'John Arledge', 'George E.

Lemuel then finds Tom meeting with his golf committee rather than working. When the boys argue that business is only a means to an end, and that happiness and enjoyment of life are desired goals, Lemuel counters their contentions by declaring that what they really need are wives and tells them that Dorothy and Rose Gregson, the daughters of an old friend, will soon be visiting. During the party, Fleurette, a French singer hired by Billy, goes to Lemuel's bedroom to undress before her performance, and after an embarrassing moment, she and Lemuel become friends. She encourages him to loosen up, and after awhile, he saunters downstairs drunk, just as the statue, supposedly a distinguished work of modern art, is being unveiled. Billy worries that Fleurette may be a blackmailer. Sometime later, Billy, Tom and Lemuel's staid partner, Noah Marley, are concerned because Lemuel has not shown up for an important meeting. Since meeting Fleurette, Lemuel is never at home, and he has been arrested in a speakeasy raid. Lemuel arrives at the office in top hat and tails, and when his sons act indignant at his behavior, he reiterates their own philosophy and leaves skipping with Fleurette to go to the races. Billy and Tom call detectives to follow them. At the track, the detectives spy Fleurette introduce Lemuel to Harry Lamson, an infamous blackmailer, but they conclude that she is worth the money it will cost Lemuel. Fleurette tells Lemuel that Lamson is a friend of the man who sold Billy the statue, Colonel Stanhope, and that Stanhope went to Colorado, where her mother owns some land. Lemuel agrees to go with her to check on the land, and Billy and Tom, believing that they left to get married, follow with Marley, the Gregson sisters, who have just arrived in town, the detectives and a judge. At the Hotel Colorado, a suspicious man watches as Lemuel and Fleurette register. When Stanhope boasts that he sold Fleurette's mother's land for $2,000, Lemuel reveals that he has learned that Stanhope made $40,000 from the deal. Lemuel then asserts that the statue Billy bought was in reality a hunk of granite that a drunkard ordered for a tombstone. By warning Stanhope that, as an ex-convict, he could get a ten-year sentence for fraud, Lemuel induces him to pay $40,000 for a large rock he unveils in a ceremony in the hotel lobby. In her bedroom, as Fleurette embraces Lemuel to thank him, the man who earlier spied upon them bursts in and reveals that he is Fleurette's husband. Lemuel is certain that the couple will blackmail him, but thinks the experience has been worth it and takes out his checkbook. Fleurette, disappointed in Lemuel, explains that she left her husband because of his jealousy, and the husband contends that her mother sent for him to check on the land. Convinced that they are telling the truth, Lemuel says that he and Fleurette are not in love, but just good pals. As they shake hands, Lemuel's sons and their party intrude. Lemuel explains that he wanted to teach his sons a lesson, but that he learned one himself: that anyone is dead who lets life pass him by. He then goes on an ocean liner to Paris with Fleurette and her husband, and brings along Marley, who soon sports a toupee and an entourage of attractive young women. The toupee, however, falls into the water, and everyone laughs.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0022591/?ref_=sr_i_301,"['George Ade', 'Edwin J.

Grant has opened to settlers thanks to a treaty with the Sioux Indians. After the three rogues ride off, they spy a lone wagon with a tempting string of thoroughbreds. Before they can steal the horses, however, the wagon is attacked by a gang led by Layne Hunter, a shifty saloon owner from Custer. The trio chase off the gang, and as they are about to abscond with the horses, they find pretty Lee Carleton, whose father was killed in the attack. Believing that the men are her rescuers, Lee tells them that she and her father were traveling to Custer to file a claim on a gold mine. Bull and his pals escort Lee to Custer and help her set up camp in preparation for the next morning's land rush. Determined to get their hands on the gold mine, the trio decides that one of them must marry Lee. They cut cards to see who will propose first, and Bronco, much to his dismay, wins. Lee gently turns him down, telling him that he is like a brother to her. She tells the same thing to Ace and then to Bull, who is genuinely interested in her. He confesses that he and his friends ""ain't exactly gentlemen,"" but her faith in them is not swayed. Meanwhile, Hunter's henchman Nelson spies on the group and learns of the map. Bronco and Ace decide to find Lee a husband whom they can kill after he gains the title to the mine, and they search for an eligible candidate in the saloon. They return with Bull to the camp, where they see Lee kissing her fiancé, Bruce Randall, who has come from the East. Overjoyed that the map will soon be owned by a fair competitor, the men bid Lee goodnight and promise to treat Bruce ""like a gold mine."" Hunter and his men capture Lee in the night, however, then steal her map, and send some of their numbers to cross the line before the land rush and block the pass, while Hunter remains waiting for the signal to cross the line legally. Bull and Bruce rescue Lee from the saloon, and Lee, knowing the map by heart, leads the men on a furious ride to the mine. Hunter and his men and the team of Bull, Bronco, Ace and Bruce shoot it out until Hunter's men ride off and Bull topples Hunter off a cliff. Lee thanks her friends and offers to share her claim with them.

The crew's first catch is a couple of big bass. They encounter seals on shore and take two pups for pets, returning them later when they turn out to be too much trouble. The crew meets a fleet of tuna boats and is invited aboard. One boat will hold 140 tons of fish. Later they encounter a whaling fleet. When a whale is caught, it is stripped of its blubber, a procedure called flensing. The blubber comes off in one large strip called the blanket, which is cut into chunks to be boiled down for the oil. The rest of the carcass is then ground up for fertilizer. The crew stops at an island to obtain fresh water and they learn that a devil fish in the neighboring waters has scared away the natives' food fish. They decide to catch the devil fish with the aid of a native, Pancho, who sells sharks' fins for a living. First, however, the crew catches fish for the natives. Soon the water is filled with sharks, including a leopard shark and a hammerhead. The crew explores a sunken ship where moray eels are rumored to breed and finding no eels they catch several sting rays instead. Finding themselves in the midst of a school of porpoises, they remember the sailors' belief that to kill them is bad luck, and continue without harming the animals. Finally, the crew encounters the devil fish, a large manta ray. After eleven hours of struggle, they land the fish, which at 4,200 pounds and 17 feet across is so large that it takes nine hours to tow it 18 miles.

A year later, Wanda is head telephone operator at the Hotel Keswick, where Blake conducts business. Meanwhile, The Bulletin has been printing stories implicating Blake in Kelly's demise. In order to divert attention from himself, Blake creates a scandal involving Senator Matt Stanton, who is spearheading the investigation of him. At the hotel, Blake blackmails Stanton into dropping his reform bill by threatening to expose Stanton's past love affair in the next morning's newspaper. Meanwhile, Bulletin reporter Bert Benedict offers to pay Wanda to listen in on Blake's calls. Unaware of the name of Stanton's former liaison, Blake sends henchman Jim Neligan to pay the hotel operator for the phone number of Stanton's next call, assuming he will be calling the woman to warn her. When Tom's brother-in-law, Senator Phil Roberts, who is in league with Blake, calls the same number, Wanda realizes Blake's own daughter Grace is the woman, and refuses to report to either Benedict or Neligan. Blake, meanwhile, pays Stanton's ex-secretary, Vera Lorraine, to give him the name, and she promises to deliver it the next morning. That night, Tom and Wanda spend a romantic evening together after a year's separation, and she tells him his father has come between them. The next morning, Grace arrives at the hotel and Wanda warns her to stop her father's involvement in the Stanton scandal. When Vera telephones, Wanda intercepts the call. As the press waits, Grace runs to Tom for help and Wanda is ordered to report to Blake. When Blake realizes Kelly's daughter is the woman he tried to bribe, he threatens to put her in prison for intercepting Vera's call. Wanda resists naming Grace until Blake cruelly reminds Wanda of her father's fate. As Tom and Grace arrive, Wanda blurts out Grace's phone number and Blake, mortified, says he is through with politics.

There he meets penniless showgirl Norma Selbee and, intoxicated by her beauty, proposes marriage the same night. Confident that she will fall in love with him in time, Norma accepts Gordon's impetuous proposal, and the couple marries. While on her European honeymoon, however, Norma grows weary of Gordon's displays of generosity and adoration and secretly curses him for not trying to win her love. Then, in France, Norma runs into Lawrence Marchmont, an old friend, who uses his skills as a womanizer to seduce the newlywed. Driven to hysterics by Gordon's uncontrolled affection, Norma denounces her husband for never trying to romance her and locks herself in her bedroom. Although Gordon breaks down the door and enters Norma's room, she leaves for Paris with Marchmont the next day. Heartbroken and angry, Gordon follows the couple to Paris and swears to them that if they ever separate he will send both of them to jail. Gordon then reveals that he has discovered that Norma's first husband, Jim Selbee, never officially divorced her and that Marchmont, whose real name is Tommy Pierce, is a wanted embezzler and swindler. To keep his vow, Gordon hires private detectives to shadow the couple after they return to New York. There Norma soon sees that Gordon was correct about Marchmont when she is forced to resume her showgirl career to support him and his drinking habit. Although Norma grows to hate Marchmont, Gordon forces his rival to remain with her, even after he tries to flee with her jewels. Eventually Norma is confronted by Selbee and, to protect Gordon from his blackmail, agrees to return to her first marriage. While Norma discusses the matter with Gordon, Selbee shows up at the Kent estate and finds a drunken Marchmont there. Together Selbee and Marchmont plot to steal Norma's jewels, but as Selbee is opening Gordon's safe, Marchmont shoots and kills him. After Marchmont is apprehended by the police, Gordon finds Norma and begs her to forgive him. Although Norma at first refuses to reconcile with her husband, her roommate tells Gordon that, in spite of her words, Norma truly loves him.

588. Riders of the Cactus,1931,1h,Passed,,,,"This film and ""Flying Lariats,1931"" were filmed in a week on location in Sonora, California (interiors shot at Universal) with the exact same cast in both films. Both were produced (for Big 4) by a company named Hooper-Connell Corp.,Ltd, which was cameraman R.B. Hooper and brothers Robert and Charles T. Connell. Hooper shot both films, David Kirkland wrote and directed both and Charles T. Connell edited both, minus a credit line. Common mistakes regarding both films is that an elder actor named Joe Lawliss was in both (and billed as such) but some source has evidently decided Joe Lawliss didn't know how to spell his own name and has incorrectly changed it to Joe Lawless. Some source also thinks that the Don Wilson credited in both films is the same Don Wilson that was the announcer on the Jack Benny radio and television programs. He ain't. Etta Delmas is in both films (same cast in both) but some source has decided that her role in ""Flying Lariats"" was played by an actress that doesn't exist named Etta Dalsing. Well, she didn't exist until said source created her. The plot of ""Riders of the Cactus"" must have taken four of the seven shooting days as it is more involved than the one in ""Flying Lariats."" This one revolves around an old Latin parchment which holds the secret to the location of a buried Spanish treasure. American tourist Josie Casey and her Aunt Sarah come into possession of the document, but transposing Latin is neither's strong suit, which need not be meant to imply that acting was. But Jake McKeever/Jake Wenzel does and intends to acquire it. He has his wife Pearl (Tete Brady), bar girl wearing a one-piece bathing suit or corset or something but making whatever it is look really good, distract Border Patrolman Bob Bronson while Jake gets the document from the Caseys. Jake and his gang head for the Sonoran desert. They are followed by a prospector leading a blanket-covered mule train. Jake and his men are a little miffed when Border Patrolmen and Mexican Rurales come out from under the blankets. There were several of these Hopper-McConnell westerns shot over a short period of time, and a few of them appear like they mixed up some reels in the editing process, as character names and situations sometimes change in a New York minute. But that doesn't account for the Joe Lawless/Etta Delsing/Don Wilson errors.
