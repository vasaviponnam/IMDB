Found unconscious with a head wound two years earlier in the streets of Washington, Alexander, now a mind reader in the act, cannot remember anything about his previous life. Beverly Lane, whose brother Paul disappeared two years earlier, listens intently to her radio, but her uncle, financier John Carrington, calls the announcement a cheap publicity stunt. When Beverly insists on going to the theater, Carrington accompanies her. Before his performance, Chatrand, upon seeing Beverly through the stage curtains, recognizes her from a picture in the locket Alexander carries. He has always wanted to meet the woman in the picture. During the act, Chatrand blindfolds Alexander and has him describe objects belonging to members of the audience and answer their questions. When Chatrand asks Alexander to describe Beverly's locket, which is identical to Alexander's, Carrington protests and struggles with Chatrand. Sonya, Chatrand's assistant, pulls a light switch. In the dark, a hand wearing a spider ring fires a gun, and Carrington falls. The police soon arrive and keep the audience from leaving, as a man from the audience, Dr. Blackstone, attends to Carrington. After Inspector Riley finds a gun beside Alexander, who is unconscious, Chatrand removes Alexander's mask. Beverly then embraces him and identifies him as her lost brother. Chatrand brings Alexander out of his trance, and upon seeing Beverly, Alexander exclaims, ""He tried to kill me; I had to do it!"" Treating this as a confession, Riley has Alexander and Beverly taken to the theater manager's office, while he keeps Chatrand under observation. Chatrand, however, escapes into a casket and then through a trap door. Alexander tells Beverly that two years earlier Carrington attempted to steal all their money, and that when Carrington tried to kill him, he fell, precipitating his amnesia. Chatrand then finds out that Carrington had been receiving telephone calls from someone who lost a great deal of money to him. When Riley learns that Carrington has died, he arrests Alexander for first-degree murder. Chatrand, however, convinces Riley to let him conduct a seance before the audience is allowed to leave to try to make the murderer betray himself. During the seance, as Chatrand's image appears before the audience, and Carrington, speaking through Chatrand, threatens to name his murderer, a shot breaks the mirror which is conveying the image. Chatrand next has Alexander, in the guise of a mind reader, attempt to ""find"" the mind of the murderer. After he reveals a number of dark secrets in the minds of some audience members, Alexander says that the murderer wears a spider ring, and he names the row in which the murderer is sitting. As he is about to reveal the murderer's seat number, a shot rings out. Dr. Blackstone, who hysterically says that Carrington deserved death for ruining a savings bank and turning his family and thousands of others into paupers, is apprehended.

Lemuel then finds Tom meeting with his golf committee rather than working. When the boys argue that business is only a means to an end, and that happiness and enjoyment of life are desired goals, Lemuel counters their contentions by declaring that what they really need are wives and tells them that Dorothy and Rose Gregson, the daughters of an old friend, will soon be visiting. During the party, Fleurette, a French singer hired by Billy, goes to Lemuel's bedroom to undress before her performance, and after an embarrassing moment, she and Lemuel become friends. She encourages him to loosen up, and after awhile, he saunters downstairs drunk, just as the statue, supposedly a distinguished work of modern art, is being unveiled. Billy worries that Fleurette may be a blackmailer. Sometime later, Billy, Tom and Lemuel's staid partner, Noah Marley, are concerned because Lemuel has not shown up for an important meeting. Since meeting Fleurette, Lemuel is never at home, and he has been arrested in a speakeasy raid. Lemuel arrives at the office in top hat and tails, and when his sons act indignant at his behavior, he reiterates their own philosophy and leaves skipping with Fleurette to go to the races. Billy and Tom call detectives to follow them. At the track, the detectives spy Fleurette introduce Lemuel to Harry Lamson, an infamous blackmailer, but they conclude that she is worth the money it will cost Lemuel. Fleurette tells Lemuel that Lamson is a friend of the man who sold Billy the statue, Colonel Stanhope, and that Stanhope went to Colorado, where her mother owns some land. Lemuel agrees to go with her to check on the land, and Billy and Tom, believing that they left to get married, follow with Marley, the Gregson sisters, who have just arrived in town, the detectives and a judge. At the Hotel Colorado, a suspicious man watches as Lemuel and Fleurette register. When Stanhope boasts that he sold Fleurette's mother's land for $2,000, Lemuel reveals that he has learned that Stanhope made $40,000 from the deal. Lemuel then asserts that the statue Billy bought was in reality a hunk of granite that a drunkard ordered for a tombstone. By warning Stanhope that, as an ex-convict, he could get a ten-year sentence for fraud, Lemuel induces him to pay $40,000 for a large rock he unveils in a ceremony in the hotel lobby. In her bedroom, as Fleurette embraces Lemuel to thank him, the man who earlier spied upon them bursts in and reveals that he is Fleurette's husband. Lemuel is certain that the couple will blackmail him, but thinks the experience has been worth it and takes out his checkbook. Fleurette, disappointed in Lemuel, explains that she left her husband because of his jealousy, and the husband contends that her mother sent for him to check on the land. Convinced that they are telling the truth, Lemuel says that he and Fleurette are not in love, but just good pals. As they shake hands, Lemuel's sons and their party intrude. Lemuel explains that he wanted to teach his sons a lesson, but that he learned one himself: that anyone is dead who lets life pass him by. He then goes on an ocean liner to Paris with Fleurette and her husband, and brings along Marley, who soon sports a toupee and an entourage of attractive young women. The toupee, however, falls into the water, and everyone laughs.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0022591/?ref_=sr_i_301

588. Riders of the Cactus,1931,1h,Passed,,,,"This film and ""Flying Lariats,1931"" were filmed in a week on location in Sonora, California (interiors shot at Universal) with the exact same cast in both films. Both were produced (for Big 4) by a company named Hooper-Connell Corp.,Ltd, which was cameraman R.B. Hooper and brothers Robert and Charles T. Connell. Hooper shot both films, David Kirkland wrote and directed both and Charles T. Connell edited both, minus a credit line. Common mistakes regarding both films is that an elder actor named Joe Lawliss was in both (and billed as such) but some source has evidently decided Joe Lawliss didn't know how to spell his own name and has incorrectly changed it to Joe Lawless. Some source also thinks that the Don Wilson credited in both films is the same Don Wilson that was the announcer on the Jack Benny radio and television programs. He ain't. Etta Delmas is in both films (same cast in both) but some source has decided that her role in ""Flying Lariats"" was played by an actress that doesn't exist named Etta Dalsing. Well, she didn't exist until said source created her. The plot of ""Riders of the Cactus"" must have taken four of the seven shooting days as it is more involved than the one in ""Flying Lariats."" This one revolves around an old Latin parchment which holds the secret to the location of a buried Spanish treasure. American tourist Josie Casey and her Aunt Sarah come into possession of the document, but transposing Latin is neither's strong suit, which need not be meant to imply that acting was. But Jake McKeever/Jake Wenzel does and intends to acquire it. He has his wife Pearl (Tete Brady), bar girl wearing a one-piece bathing suit or corset or something but making whatever it is look really good, distract Border Patrolman Bob Bronson while Jake gets the document from the Caseys. Jake and his gang head for the Sonoran desert. They are followed by a prospector leading a blanket-covered mule train. Jake and his men are a little miffed when Border Patrolmen and Mexican Rurales come out from under the blankets. There were several of these Hopper-McConnell westerns shot over a short period of time, and a few of them appear like they mixed up some reels in the editing process, as character names and situations sometimes change in a New York minute. But that doesn't account for the Joe Lawless/Etta Delsing/Don Wilson errors. Those have been created in the past few years.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0022312/?ref_=sr_i_588
