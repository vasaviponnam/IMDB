AFSAR-1950

Though not a blast from the past, the golden era of Indian cinema, film ""AFSAR"" of 1950, starring Dev Anand, Suriya with Kanhaiya Lal, Zohra Sehgal etc. Director Chetan Anand, Producer Dev Anand, though a really enjoyable classical comedy deep-set in a historical reality, seems to have been lost from the memory of even really old film lovers just as it has actually been lost from prints as neither DVD or Internet is available anywhere in Pakistan or even in India.

The story is skillfully set in the last era of British rule when after several historical land reforms in the subcontinent, the government faced the gigantic problem of assessing the actual incomes of landlords to net them in for state revenues. For purpose of direct assessments revenue officers were deputed, while for a larger number of indirect assessments, persons were sent and dispersed to villages in disguise of varying professions and for longer periods to secretly make their own assessment of on the spot realities and of actual sources and incomes.

Dev Anand a smart but long unemployed city youth unaware of the fact that persons have been secretly deputed in disguise to villages, goes along with an illiterate quirky assistant and with no equipment, bare straw furniture and with not even the barest of medical knowledge goes to a village and sets up a dispensary as a last attempt at livelihood.

Soon the ludicrous village simpletons of various sizes and shapes with rustic attires, accents and ways, a real entertainment to watch in the film, finding Dev Anand far removed from their lot, start spying on his activities, peeping in the dispensary through its falling windows and holes, and begin to spin up tales of him being of the disguised agents rumored to have been sent to asses incomes and their sources, and cook up their stories so convincingly that the owner of the entire village, the landlord, already under fear of losing some of his income and even property to the state, believes his men and their tales.

He invites Dev Anand to his impressive haveli, gives him a reception and respect and starts discussions on some medical issues. However the unconvincing, naïve and evasive replies of Dev Anand on medicine further leads the landlord to believe that he is really the agent sent by the state to rope him and his vast income. He offers Dev Anand to stay at his haveli and Dev by now having realized what his is being mistaken for, starts skillfully playing the role of his mistaken identity or rather misperceived identity. The landlord introduces Dev Anand made purposely as a permanent guest to his daughter who is learning dancing and music, and she entertains Dev Anand with some classical songs and dances which are a part of the film.

Without much time and effort while staying at the haveli Dev Anand seduces her by his charms into a relationship without thinking of the consequences.

The landlord had been advised by his men that whatever reports Dev Anand sends to his superiors in the city will necessarily go through the village post office where by design it can be checked and brought back to the landlord to have him see its contents.

Call it misfortune or climax to come Dev Anand sends a letter to a friend in his city, narrating to him how he is enjoying in the village due to a mistaken identity. He also comments on each, the landlord his daughter and village folk, and their idiosyncrasies in the most humorous and somewhere disparaging words. This letter by scheme lands back in the hands of the landlord and read in a village gathering.

Dev Anand is also informed by some one of the letter falling into the villagers hands, and he plans to escape. However he confides to the landlords daughter that he is not the one they all are thinking to be, but is just an unemployed miserable young man, who had come to set up a dispensary in the village. The heroine says she accepts he as he is and will always be his companion, and both plan to run away from the village and make for the small railway station.

In the meantime the villagers, who had read the letter exposing Dev Anand, and his sarcastic comments about all in the village, and knowing that he has fled with the landlord's daughter, run towards the railway station. While they are after him, chasing the pair ferociously, Dev and his eloping lady miss the train by a few minutes. What happens can be well imagined, but the end is not within the memory of this writer.

(Stoney is shown in front of two theatres where Columbia, missing no bets, has displays of one-sheet posters from ""Strawberry Roan"" with Gene Autry and ""The Undercover Man"" with Glenn Ford.) Reporter Vera Wright (Jeff Donnell), following him to get a story of a failure, informs Stoney that he is a never-was has-been, and they find themselves stranded in the hometown of Eddy Arnold, where Eddy's film ""cousin"" Carolina Cotton (Carolina Cotton) quickly takes a shine to the shy and clumsy Stoney. Eddy sees a print of Stoney's film in which the character is singing ""I Can't Shake the Sands of Texas From My Shoes"" and is impressed and telephones his agent Sam Baker (Fred Sears) to come there quickly and sign Stoney to a contract, especially since he sounds like Gene Autry. Meanwhile, some bank robbers and gangsters get involved and have their eyes on the proceeds from a charity fund-raiser Eddy is doing. When the agent shows up to sign Stoney to a recording contract because ""you sound like Gene Autry"", Stoney says that is because it was Gene Autry doing the singing in the film. The film is somewhat of an inside joke built around ace stuntman Mahoney, in that his Stoney role is the opposite of his real-life abilities, and most of the males in the cast, Big Boy Williams, Douglas Fowley, Don Harvey and Charles Sullivan, takes turns beating him up and knocking him out...when he isn't falling out of hay lofts or involved in accidents. But a kiss from Carolina makes a new man out of him and the gangsters are rounded up in a one-man blitz, and Stoney ends up with eight studios bidding for his services. Eddy performs most of his best-selling hits of the day, with the exception of ""Cattle Call"", the vastly-underrated Carolina Cotton (as a performer and actress with a personality) yodels up a storm, and this overall turns out to be a pretty fair little sleeper, especially in regards to films where Hollywood takes a poke at itself.And probably unknown to those who go around compiling such lists.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0042565/?ref_=sr_i_516,['Barry Shipman'],['Ray Nazarro'],"['Eddy Arnold', 'Jeff Donnell', 'Jock Mahoney', ""Guinn 'Big Boy' Williams"", 'Carolina Cotton', 'The Pied Pipers', 'Hal Hopper', 'June Hutton', 'Chuck Lowry', 'Clark Yocum']",,,,,"June 1, 1950",['United States'],,['Columbia Pictures'],,"['Drama', 'Music', 'Western']",['English']

Phillip tells him the play is no good, and suggests that Jed try a mystery instead. They fight, but are interrupted by the arrival of a visitor. After Phillip asks Jed to keep his upcoming trip to Honolulu a secret, Jed leaves, taking the visitor's scarf with him. The next morning, Jed reads in the newspaper that Phillip has been murdered. Jed confers with his girl friend, talent agent Myra Peters, whose brother Bill, a police lieutenant, is leading the investigation into Phillip's death. Although he did not see the murderer, Jed starts a rumor that he has inside information about the crime, hoping to scare the killer into revealing his or her identity. They go to the theater, where Bill has assembled everyone for the investigation, and Myra suggests that Jed rewrite his play to incorporate the facts of the case. Jed and Myra tell Bill about their plan, and he informs them that Phillip was strangled, and that some fingerprints found on the door will soon be identified. Jed and Myra listen through the intercom as Bill questions Mrs. Mannings and Phillip's associates, including John Webb, his financial backer. Mrs. Mannings says that she hated her husband, who was unfaithful, and suggests that Bill question Corinne Hollister, who was set to star in Jed's play before Phillip rejected it. Bill tells Jed that a panhandler named Shuffalong reported seeing a man matching Jed's description entering Phillip's building the previous night. After Bill leaves, Jed receives an anonymous telegram warning him that if he writes the play, he must do justice to the role of Jed Kilgore. While Bill is at the telegraph office trying to find out who sent the message, Jed is attacked by an unidentified man. They fight and the man escapes, taking the scarf with him. Rehearsals for Jed's new play begin, and Bill becomes increasingly suspicious of Jed. Speculating that Corinne was going to accompany Phillip to Honolulu, Jed goes to the airport and inquires about reservations under her name, and the clerk immediately calls Bill to report this. As Jed is leaving the airport, someone shoots at him and misses. During intermission on opening night of Jed's play, Bill arrests Jed, but Jed escapes on the way to the police station. Meanwhile, the killer hides inside Myra's dressing room, but Jed arrives in time to rescue her, although the killer gets away. Jed then takes over the leading man's role himself, and when he confronts Corinne onstage with a scarf that Myra knit for him, she says that she knitted it for her father. To the audience's surprise, Webb then walks onto the stage and objects to Jed's accusations. Corinne reproaches Webb for being a controlling father, adding that she changed her name to get away from him. Webb tells her that he is her foster father, her real father having deserted her, and admits to killing Phillip because of his affair with Corinne.

Soured on anything to do with love and while drinking away her sorrows, she sets out to marry the very first man she sees. This man just happens to be a nice guy named Roberto, (Abel Salazar). Although the pair's mutual attraction to each other is obvious, Roberto has no idea what he is in for, and he soon proposes. Not long after the marriage, Leticia starts to take advantage of both Roberto and her new Father-in-Law (played by Oscar Pulido), who shows kindness towards the girl. Predictably, marital bliss soon turns into discord, and the couple agree to divorce after a year passes. Their love-hate relationship and pending break-up provides a perfect backdrop for several comedic situations before the two realize that they are actually in love.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0256529/?ref_=sr_i_593,"['Ernesto Cortázar', 'Antonio Monsell', 'Pedro de Urdimalas']",['René Cardona'],"['María Elena Marqués', 'Abel Salazar', 'Óscar Pulido', 'Queta Lavat', 'Aurora Walker', 'Luis Mussot', 'José Pulido', 'Amparo Arozamena', 'Eugenia Galindo', 'Antonio Bravo']",,,,,"January 5, 1950",['Mexico'],['Mexico'],['Alameda Films'],,"['Comedy', 'Drama']",['Spanish']
